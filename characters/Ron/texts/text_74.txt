Harry:「“Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up.」
Ron:「“We’re going to miss the train,” Ron whispered. “I don’t understand why the gateway’s sealed itself —”」
Harry:「“Why can’t we get through?” Harry hissed to Ron.」
Ron:「“I dunno —”」
Ron:「“Can’t hear a thing,” he said tensely. “What’re we going to do? I don’t know how long it’ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us.”」
Harry:「“What about it?”」
Ron:「“We can fly the car to Hogwarts!”」
Harry:「“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”」
Ron:「“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother with Floo powder and the car because we’re all underage and we’re not allowed to Apparate yet. . . .”」
