Sirius:「Yeah, I’ve heard it’s become a bit of a mania with him, If you ask me, he still thinks he can bring back the old popularity by catching one more Death Eater, that doesn’t make sense at all, I think they’ve both got a point, Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here, I’ve wondered why Dumbledore hired him. Snape’s always been fascinated by the Dark Arts, he was famous for it at school. Slimy, oily, greasy-haired kid, he was, Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year, and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters, Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well, but he wants to keep that quiet, Well, I’ve no idea what that’s about . . . but if Karkaroff’s genuinely worried, and he’s going to Snape for answers . . .」
Ron:「And he sneaked up here to search Snape’s office!, Yeah, it does!, Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape —, Oh give it a rest, Hermione, I know Dumbledore’s brilliant and everything, but that doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool him —, Yeah, you should’ve seen Snape’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!, Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape’s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn’t see what it was.」
