Hagrid:「Yep. Couple of ’em were visitin’ him ev’ry day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg, an’ he wasn’ dangling them upside down.」
Ron:「How d’you know they were Death Eaters?」
Hagrid:「Because I recognized one of ’em, Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin’ as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin’ on so well.」
Hermione:「So Macnair’s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?」
Hagrid:「Hold yer hippogriffs, I haven’ finished me story yet! Me an’ Olympe talked it over an’ we agreed, jus’ ’cause the Gurg looked like favorin’ You-Know-Who didn’ mean all of ’em would. We had ter try an’ persuade some o’ the others, the ones who hadn’ wanted Golgomath as Gurg.」
Ron:「How could you tell which ones they were?」
