Hermione:「Are — you — insane?」
Ron:「I dunno, If Harry wants to do it, it’s up to him, isn’t it?」
Fred:「Spoken like a true friend and Weasley, Right, then. We’re thinking of doing it tomorrow, just after lessons, because it should cause maximum impact if everybody’s in the corridors — Harry, we’ll set it off in the east wing somewhere, draw her right away from her own office — I reckon we should be able to guarantee you, what, twenty minutes?」
George:「Easy.」
Ron:「What sort of diversion is it?」
Ron:「Hermione, are you going to stop telling Harry off and listen to Binns, or am I going to have to take notes instead?」
