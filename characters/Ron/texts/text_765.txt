Neville:「Yeah, well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave, I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was, they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn’t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway, Neville laughed, Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and Gran’s on the run. She sent me a letter, telling me she was proud of me, that I’m my parents’ son, and to keep it up.」
Ron:「Cool.」
Neville:「Yeah, Neville happily. Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.」
Ron:「“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t — aren’t we heading straight back into Hogwarts?”」
