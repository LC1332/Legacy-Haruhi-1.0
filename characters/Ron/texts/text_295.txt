Harry:「I’m tired! No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed —」
Narrator:Harry think "He wanted more than anything to find Ron and Hermione, to find a bit of sanity, but neither of them seemed to be in the common room. Insisting that he needed to sleep, and almost flattening the little Creevey brothers as they attempted to waylay him at the foot of the stairs, Harry managed to shake everyone off and climb up to the dormitory as fast as he could."
Ron:「Where’ve you been?」
Harry:「What d’you mean, congratulations?」
Ron:「Well . . . no one else got across the Age Line. Not even Fred and George. What did you use — the Invisibility Cloak?」
Harry:「I dunno.」
Ron:「It’s okay, you know, you can tell me the truth. If you don’t want everyone else to know, fine, but I don’t know why you’re bothering to lie, you didn’t get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady’s, that Violet, she’s already told us all Dumbledore’s letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don’t have to do end-of-year tests either. . . .」
