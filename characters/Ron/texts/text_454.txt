Harry:「OUCH!」
Ron:「What happened? Was it your scar?」
Harry:「Nothing, I — poked myself in the eye, that’s all . . .」
Ron:「He — he can’t be near us now, can he?」
Harry:「He wants something done, and it’s not happening fast enough. But . . . how do you know?」
Ron:「Is this what it was about last time? When your scar hurt in Umbridge’s office? You-Know-Who was angry?」
Harry:「No, it’s more like . . . his mood, I suppose. I’m just getting flashes of what mood he’s in. . . . Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year. . . . He said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell. Well, now I’m feeling it when he’s pleased too . . .」
Ron:「You’ve got to tell someone. I told Sirius last time. Well, tell him about this time! Can’t, can I? Umbridge is watching the owls and the fires, remember? Well then, Dumbledore — I’ve just told you, he already knows. There’s no point telling him again.」
