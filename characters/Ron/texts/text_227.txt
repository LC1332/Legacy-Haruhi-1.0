Percy:「Hi, Harry. I was wondering who was making all the noise. I’m trying to work in here, you know — I’ve got a report to finish for the office — and it’s rather difficult to concentrate when people keep thundering up and down the stairs.」
Ron:「We’re not thundering. We’re walking. Sorry if we’ve disturbed the top-secret workings of the Ministry of Magic.」
Harry:「What are you working on?」
Percy:「A report for the Department of International Magical Cooperation. We’re trying to standardize cauldron thickness. Some of these foreign imports are just a shade too thin — leakages have been increasing at a rate of almost three percent a year —」
Ron:「That’ll change the world, that report will. Front page of the Daily Prophet, I expect, cauldron leaks.」
Ron:「Yeah, yeah, all right」
