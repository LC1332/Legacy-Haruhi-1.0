Hermione:「Stay there!」
:Hermione whispered excitedly
Ron:「Light?」
Hermione:「Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!」
Harry:「The what?」
Hermione:「Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look — read that, there.」
Harry:「See? The dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!」
Harry:「A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying! No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.」
Ron:「And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?」
