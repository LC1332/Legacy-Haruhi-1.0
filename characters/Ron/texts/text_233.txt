Harry:「Who d’you reckon they are? They don’t go to Hogwarts, do they?」
Ron:「’Spect they go to some foreign school. I know there are others. Never met anyone who went to one, though. Bill had a penfriend at a school in Brazil . . . this was years and years ago . . . and he wanted to go on an exchange trip but Mum and Dad couldn’t afford it. His penfriend got all offended when he said he wasn’t going and sent him a cursed hat. It made his ears shrivel up.」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry laughed but didn’t voice the amazement he felt at hearing about other Wizarding schools. He supposed, now that he saw representatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had been stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn’t be the only one. He glanced at Hermione, who looked utterly unsurprised by the information. No doubt she had run across the news about other Wizarding schools in some book or other."
George:「“You’ve been ages,” said George when they finally got back to the Weasleys’ tents.」
Ron:「“Met a few people,” said Ron, setting the water down. “You not got that fire started yet?”」
