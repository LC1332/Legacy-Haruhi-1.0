Hermione:「“Harry! Harry! Are you all right?”」
Ron:「“Are you okay?”」
Lupin:「“Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. “Eat it. It’ll help.”」
Lupin:「“A dementor,” said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. “One of the dementors of Azkaban.”」
Hermione:「“Are you sure you’re okay, Harry?”」
Harry:「“I don’t get it. . . . What happened?”」
Ron:「“I thought you were having a fit or something,” said Ron, who still looked scared. “You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching —”」
Ron:「“I felt weird,” said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. “Like I’d never be cheerful again. . . .”」
Ron:「No, Ginny was shaking like mad, though. . . .」
