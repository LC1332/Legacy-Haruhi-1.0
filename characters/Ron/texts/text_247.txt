Mr. Weasley:「We can’t prove it was them, Bill. Though it probably was,」
Ron:「Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!」
Harry:「But what were Voldemort’s supporters —」
Everybody:「flinched — like most of the Wizarding world, the Weasleys always avoided saying Voldemort’s name.」

Narrator:Mr. Weasley think "Harry, that’s their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn’t resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them,"
Ron:「But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark? They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t they?」
