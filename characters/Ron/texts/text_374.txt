Harry:「Who’s Kreacher?」
Ron:「The house-elf who lives here, Nutter. Never met one like him.」
Hermione:「He’s not a nutter, Ron —」
Ron:「His life’s ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother. Is that normal, Hermione?」
Hermione:「It’s not ‘spew’! It’s the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too —」
Ron:「C’mon, I’m starving.」
