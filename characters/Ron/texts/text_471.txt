Hagrid:「Probably woulda done if they’d bin in any condition, but they was badly hurt, all three o’ them. Golgomath’s lot had beaten ’em unconscious; they’d woken up an’ crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find. Anyway, one o’ them had a bit of English an’ ’e translated fer the others, an’ what we had ter say didn’ seem ter go down too badly. So we kep’ goin’ back, visitin’ the wounded. . . . I reckon we had abou’ six or seven o’ them convinced at one poin’.」
Ron:「Six or seven? Well that’s not bad — are they going to come over here and start fighting You-Know-Who with us?」
Hermione:「What do you mean ‘at one point,’ Hagrid?」
Hagrid:「Golgomath’s lot raided the caves. The ones tha’ survived didn’ wan’ no more ter to do with us after that.」
Ron:「So . . . so there aren’t any giants coming?」
