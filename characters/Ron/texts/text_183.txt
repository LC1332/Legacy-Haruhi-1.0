Harry:「“Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he’d be able to buy himself some new robes.”」
Ron:「“Yeah, but he likes you, And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might’ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you —”」
Harry:「“What d’you mean, he was away? He was ill when I was playing in that match.”」
Ron:「“Well, he wasn’t in the hospital wing, I was there, cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, remember?”」
Ron:「“Who sent you that?”」
Ron:「“I don’t know, but it’s a bit odd, isn’t it? I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn’t it?”」
Ron:「“Probably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms put together,”」
Ron:「“Listen, Harry, can I have a go on it? Can I?”」
Ron:「“GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE!”」
Ron:「“It’s stress!”」
