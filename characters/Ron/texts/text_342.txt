Sirius:「I don’t care . . . I’ll breathe freely again when this tournament’s over, and that’s not until June. And don’t forget, if you’re talking about me among yourselves, call me Snuffles, okay?」
Ron:「Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch? But maybe he doesn’t care . . . it’d probably just make him admire Crouch even more. Yeah, Percy loves rules. He’d just say Crouch was refusing to break them for his own son.」
Hermione:「Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors.」
Ron:「If he thought we were standing in the way of his career . . . Percy’s really ambitious, you know. . . .」
