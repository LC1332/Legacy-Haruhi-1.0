Mrs. Weasley:「That’s enough — Fred — George — Ginny! Harry dear, come and sit down, have some lunch, you hardly ate breakfast . . .」
Ron:「’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you」
Harry:「Yeah, he swung it for me」
Harry:「Scar, But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the time now . . .」
Ron:「I bet Dumbledore turns up this evening to celebrate with us, you know.」
Ron:「That’s a bit harsh, Hermione, you wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without company.」
Hermione:「He just didn’t want to get his own hopes up even more, And he probably felt a bit guilty himself, because I think a part of him was really hoping you’d be expelled. Then you’d both be outcasts together.」
Harry:「Come off it!」
Ron:「Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.」
Mrs. Weasley:「Still not finished?」
Ron:「I thought you might be here to tell us to have a break! D’you know how much mold we’ve got rid of since we arrived here?」
