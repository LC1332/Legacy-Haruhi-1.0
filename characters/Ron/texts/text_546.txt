Hermione:「Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry. But haven’t we agreed there could be a lot of explanations?」
Ron:「Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory. Remember that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?」
Harry:「But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep that one safe’? That sounded to me like Borgin’s got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy wants both.」
Ron:「Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?」
Ron:「Malfoy? He’s sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?」
Ron:「Well . . .」
Ron:「I’m not sure, Harry. . . .」
