Harry:「Yeah, of course, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him.」
Ron:「Little git. He’s enjoying keeping us hanging.」
Hermione:「Harry, are you saying what I think you’re saying? Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in the Lestranges’ vault?」
Harry:「Yes. Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d been in there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we’d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.」
Ron:「But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who’s been, places he’s done something important? Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?」
