Harry:「How did you do? I think I felt something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my feet. I didn’t feel anything, But I don’t care about that now — I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying, Look, hurry up, will you, there’s something I want to do. . . .」
Ron:「Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?」
Harry:「Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing with Crabbe just now. I want to know — aha. I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . . . or Malfoy is anyway.」
Harry:「Help me find Malfoy」
Ron:「He’s in the Slytherin common room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle . . .」
