Harry:「The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach.」
Ron:「Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in.」
Ron:「There you are,」
Harry:「It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.」
Harry:「Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures.」
Ron:「Hagrid had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d christened “Fluffy.”」
Ron:「“Riddle might have got the wrong person,” said Hermione. “Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people. . . .”」
Ron:「“Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?”」
