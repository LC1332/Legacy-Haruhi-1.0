Winky:「There is bad wizards about! People high — high in the air! Winky is getting out of the way!」
Ron:「What’s up with her? Why can’t she run properly?」
Hermione:「Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide.」
Hermione:「You know, house-elves get a very raw deal! It’s slavery, that’s what it is! That Mr. Crouch made her go up to the top of the stadium, and she was terrified, and he’s got her bewitched so she can’t even run when they start trampling tents! Why doesn’t anyone do something about it?」
Ron:「Well, the elves are happy, aren’t they? You heard old Winky back at the match . . . ‘House-elves is not supposed to have fun’ . . . that’s what she likes, being bossed around. . . .」
