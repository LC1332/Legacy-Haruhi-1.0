Harry:「Bet Percy loved that.」
Ron:「He went completely berserk. He said — well, he said loads of terrible stuff. He said he’s been having to struggle against Dad’s lousy reputation ever since he joined the Ministry and that Dad’s got no ambition and that’s why we’ve always been — you know — not had a lot of money, I mean —」
Harry:「What?」
Ron:「And it got worse. He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore, that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him, and that he — Percy — knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry. And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he didn’t belong to our family anymore. And he packed his bags the same night and left. He’s living here in London now.」
Harry:「But Percy must know Voldemort’s back. He’s not stupid, he must know your mum and dad wouldn’t risk everything without proof —」
Ron:「Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row. Percy said the only evidence was your word and . . . I dunno . . . he didn’t think it was good enough.」
