Harry:「She’s taken points off Gryffindor because I’m having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?」
Ron:「I know, mate, she’s bang out of order.」
Hermione:「You think McGonagall was right, do you? I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think she’s right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge.」
Fudge:「I wish she hadn’t taken points from you, but I think she’s right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge.」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry did not speak to Hermione all through Charms, but when they entered Transfiguration he forgot his anger; Professor Umbridge and her clipboard were sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head."
Ron:「“Excellent,” whispered Ron, as they sat down in their usual seats. “Let’s see Umbridge get what she deserves.”」
