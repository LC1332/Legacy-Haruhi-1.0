Hermione:「‘Muggle-born Register.’ ‘The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-called “Muggle-borns,” the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets. ‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or force.」
Ron:「People won’t let this happen.」
Lupin:「Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.」
Ron:「But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic? It’s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs, would there?」
Hermione:「Thank you, Ron, but I couldn’t let you —」
Ron:「You won’t have a choice. I’ll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it.」
