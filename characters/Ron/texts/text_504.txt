Harry:「Yes, I did. And I don’t regret it either — I didn’t need the gold, and they’ll be great at a joke shop . . .」
Ron:「But this is excellent! It’s all your fault, Harry — Mum can’t blame me at all! Can I tell her?」
Harry:「Yeah, I suppose you’d better, ’Specially if she thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something . . .」
Hermione:「said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson」
Harry:「It’s no good nagging me, it’s done, Fred and George have got the gold — spent a good bit of it too, by the sounds of it — and I can’t get it back from them and I don’t want to. So save your breath, Hermione.」
Hermione:「I wasn’t going to say anything about Fred and George!」
Ron:「snorted disbelievingly」
