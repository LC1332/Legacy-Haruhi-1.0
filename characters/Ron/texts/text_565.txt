He looked hopefully at Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender Brown. Can you think of any way Malfoy — ?」
Ron:「Oh, drop it, Harry. Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!」
Ron:「Well, as I’m not invited to any parties, I think I’ll go to bed.」
