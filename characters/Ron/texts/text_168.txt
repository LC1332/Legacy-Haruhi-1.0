Hermione:「Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time. They’re bound to catch Black soon. He’s been sighted once already.」
Ron:「Black’s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade. Ask McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages —」
Harry:「Yeah, I think I will.」
Hermione:「Does he have to eat that in front of us?」
Hermione:「Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?」
Ron:「Just keep him over there, that’s all. I’ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag.」
:Crookshanks staring unblinkingly at Ron, flicking the end of his bushy tail
:Crookshanks pounced
Ron:「OY! GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!」
Ron:「Look at him! He’s skin and bone! You keep that cat away from him!」
Ron:「He’s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking.」
