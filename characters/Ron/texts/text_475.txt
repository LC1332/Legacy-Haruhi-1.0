Hermione:「You see what she’s up to? It’s her thing about half-breeds all over again — she’s trying to make out Hagrid’s some kind of dim-witted troll, just because he had a giantess for a mother — and oh, it’s not fair, that really wasn’t a bad lesson at all — I mean, all right, if it had been Blast-Ended Skrewts again, but thestrals are fine — in fact, for Hagrid, they’re really good!」
Ron:「Umbridge said they’re dangerous,」
Hermione:「Well, it’s like Hagrid said, they can look after themselves, and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank wouldn’t usually show them to us before N.E.W.T. level, but, well, they are very interesting, aren’t they? The way some people can see them and some can’t! I wish I could.」
Harry:「Do you?」
:Hermione action
Harry:「Oh Harry — I’m sorry — no, of course I don’t — that was a really stupid thing to say —」
Harry:「It’s okay, don’t worry . . .」
Ron:「I’m surprised so many people could see them,」
