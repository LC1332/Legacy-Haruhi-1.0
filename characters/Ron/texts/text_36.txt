Dumbledore:「convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again」
Narrator:Harry think "wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter."
Ron:「“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,”」
