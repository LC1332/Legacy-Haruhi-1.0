Hermione:「It’s hot, isn’t it? Viktor’s just gone to get some drinks.」
Ron:「Viktor? Hasn’t he asked you to call him Vicky yet?」
Hermione:「What’s up with you?」
Ron:「If you don’t know, I’m not going to tell you.」
Hermione:「Yes, he did. So what?」
Ron:「What happened — trying to get him to join spew, were you?」
Hermione:「And what’s that supposed to mean?」
Ron:「Obvious, isn’t it? He’s Karkaroff’s student, isn’t he? He knows who you hang around with. . . . He’s just trying to get closer to Harry — get inside information on him — or get near enough to jinx him —」
Hermione:「I’d never help him work out that egg! Never. How could you say something like that — I want Harry to win the tournament, Harry knows that, don’t you, Harry?」
Ron:「You’ve got a funny way of showing it,」
