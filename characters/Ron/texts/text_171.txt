Harry:「Right」
Ron:「We got as much as we could carry.」
Harry:「Thanks, What’s Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?」
Ron:「By the sound of it — everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko’s Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides.」
Ron:「We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks —」
Harry:「No, Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then Snape came in. . . .」
Ron:「Lupin drank it? Is he mad?」
Harry:「Yeah, maybe」
Harry:「Was he imagining it, or were Snape’s eyes flickering toward Lupin more often than was natural?」
Malfoy:「The dementors send their love, Potter!」
Ron:「Why isn’t anyone going in?」
