Harry:「You can’t have that, I’m sorry.」
goblin:「Then, we have a problem.」
Ron:「We can give you something else, I’ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.」
Griphook:「I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!」
Ron:「The sword’s ours —」
goblin:「And before it was Gryffindor’s, whose was it?」
Ron:「No one’s, It was made for him, wasn’t it?」
Harry:「He’s having a laugh. We can’t let him have that sword.」
Harry:「It is true? Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?」
Hermione:「I don’t know, Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there’s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.」
Ron:「It’ll be one of those goblin stories, about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.」
