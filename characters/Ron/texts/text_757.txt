Harry:「He knows. He knows, and he’s going to check where the others are, and the last one, is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it.」
Ron:「What?」
Hermione:「But what did you see? How do you know?」
Harry:「I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his head, he’s seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one last, but he could still be there within hours —」
Ron:「Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?」
Harry:「We need to get going. Can you imagine what he’s going to do once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides it isn’t safe enough?」
Ron:「But how are we going to get in?」
