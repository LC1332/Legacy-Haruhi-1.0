Ginny:「I’d much rather have Tonks in the family. At least she’s a laugh.」
Ron:「She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately. Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.」
Hermione:「That’s not fair. She still hasn’t got over what happened . . . you know . . . I mean, he was her cousin!」
Harry:「Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other! Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met —」
Hermione:「That’s not the point. She thinks it was her fault he died!」
Harry:「How does she work that one out?」
Hermione:「Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.」
Ron:「That’s stupid.」
