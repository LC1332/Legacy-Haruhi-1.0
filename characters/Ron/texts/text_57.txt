Harry:「He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.」
Ron:「Now what?」
Hermione:「These birds . . . they can’t be here just for decoration.」
Harry:「They’re not birds! They’re keys! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean . . . yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!」
Ron:「But there are hundreds of them!」
Harry:「Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. After a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.」
Harry:「That one! That big one — there — no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crumpled on one side.」
Ron:「We’ve got to close in on it!」
