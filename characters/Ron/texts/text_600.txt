Harry:「What’ve you done to him? — Nice one — I’m forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you’re forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I’m not allowed to give you orders — Yeah, I did — I’ve got a job for you. — Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you — I want you to tail Draco Malfoy. I want to know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what he’s doing. I want you to follow him around the clock. — There won’t be any need for that.」
Ron:「That was another Prince hex, wasn’t it? — That was another Prince hex, wasn’t it?」
