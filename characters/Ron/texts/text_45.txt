Hagrid:「I’ve decided to call him Norbert, He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where’s Mummy?」
Ron:「He’s lost his marbles」
Harry:「give it two weeks and Norbert’s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.」
Hagrid:「I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him, I can’t.」
Harry:「Charlie」
Ron:「You’re losing it, too. I’m Ron, remember?」
:Hermione Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed.
Ron:「It bit me! I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.」
