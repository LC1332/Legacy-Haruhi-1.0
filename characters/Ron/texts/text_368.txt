Harry:「What is this place anyway?」
Ron:「Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix」
Harry:「Is anyone going to bother telling me what the Order of the Phoenix — ?」
Hermione:「It’s a secret society, Dumbledore’s in charge, he founded it. It’s the people who fought against You-Know-Who last time.」
Harry:「Who’s in it?」
Ron:「Quite a few people — we’ve met about twenty of them, but we think there are more . . .」
Harry:「Voldemort! What’s happening? What’s he up to? Where is he? What are we doing to stop him?」
Hermione:「We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings. So we don’t know the details — but we’ve got a general idea —」
Ron:「Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see. They’re really useful.」
Hermione:「— some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order —」
Ron:「— and some of them are standing guard over something」
