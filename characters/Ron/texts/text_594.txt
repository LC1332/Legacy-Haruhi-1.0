Harry:「Not a big surprise, though, is it? Not after what happened to Katie.」
Ron:「But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition! Big birthday treat . . .」
Harry:「Happy birthday, Ron. Have a present.」
Ron:「Cheers.」
Ron:「Seriously good haul this year! See what Mum and Dad got me? Blimey, I think I’ll come of age next year too. . . .」
Harry:「No thanks.」
Ron:「Can’t have done, Come on, if you don’t hurry up, you’ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach. . . . Might make it easier, I suppose . . ., looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a third.」
Harry:「I thought you just said — ?」
Ron:「“Well, all right, I’ll come down with you, but I don’t want to eat.”」
Harry:「“Harry!” said Ron suddenly. “What?” “Harry, I can’t stand it!” “You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starting to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.」
Ron:「I can’t stop thinking about her!」
