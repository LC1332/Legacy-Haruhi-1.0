Harry:「had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard」
Ron:「Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who」
Ron:「But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing you all this. I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, but what’s the point?」
Hermione:「I think it’s fascinating」
Hermione:「It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?」
Harry:「How was Slughorn’s latest party?」
Hermione:「Oh, it was quite fun, really. I mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones.」
Ron:「The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?」
Ron:「should’ve used Muffliato, Harry.」
Ron:「You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden when I’ve got my own place」
