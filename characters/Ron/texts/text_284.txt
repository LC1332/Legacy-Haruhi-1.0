:Ron hissing, trying to make space for Krum and his fellow Durmstrang students at the Gryffindor table
Ron:「Too late」
Ron:「Yeah, that’s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy, I bet Krum can see right through him, though . . . bet he gets people fawning over him all the time. . . . Where d’you reckon they’re going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our dormitory, Harry . . . I wouldn’t mind giving him my bed, I could kip on a camp bed」
