Narrator:Harry think "Harry opened his copy of The Dream Oracle, watching Umbridge covertly. She was making notes on her clipboard now. After a few minutes she got to her feet and began to pace the room in Trelawney’s wake, listening to her conversations with students and posing questions here and there. Harry bent his head hurriedly over his book."
Narrator:Harry think "“Think of a dream, quick,” he told Ron, “in case the old toad comes our way.”"
Ron:「“I did it last time,” Ron protested, “it’s your turn, you tell me one.”」
