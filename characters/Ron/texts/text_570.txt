Harry:「Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!」
Ron:「I — I dunno, Harry, Loads of people go to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the girls’ bathroom?」
