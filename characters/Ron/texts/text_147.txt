Harry:「I need to talk to you in private,」
Ron:「Go away, Ginny,」
Ginny:「Oh, that’s nice,」
Harry:「Who d’you reckon he is?」
Ron:「Professor R. J. Lupin,」
Ron:「Well, I hope he’s up to it, He looks like one good hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . . What were you going to tell us?, How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter who wants to kill him?, No one knows how he got out of Azkaban, No one’s ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too., We could get it checked in Hogsmeade, They sell that sort of thing in Dervish and Banges, magical instruments and stuff. Fred and George told me., Yeah, I think it is, but that’s not why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honeydukes!」
