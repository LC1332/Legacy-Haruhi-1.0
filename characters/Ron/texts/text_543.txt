Hermione:「What are those?, Why, though?, Oh — I don’t know, Harry,」
Ron:「What’ve you done to him?, Wonder where his mummy is?, Given her the slip by the looks of it, Why, though?, Come on!」
Mrs. Weasley:「If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fingers together, Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?, A what?, Look, they’re so sweet. . . .」
Malfoy:「Wonder where his mummy is?」
Harry:「He was going in that direction, C’mon.」
Hermione:「That’s him, isn’t it? Turning left?」
Ron:「Big surprise.」
Harry:「Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts, looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all. Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts — or at least, to be seen buying them.」
Hermione:「Ouch! Shh! Look! He’s in there!」
Harry:「If only we could hear what they’re saying!」
Ron:「Extendable Ears, look!」
