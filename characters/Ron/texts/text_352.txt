Moody:「Of course. Took a leaf out of your book, Potter. Summoned it from my office into the forest. He wasn’t anywhere on there.」
Ron:「So he did Disapparate?」
Hermione:「There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren’t there, Professor?」
Moody:「You’re another one who might think about a career as an Auror. Mind works the right way, Granger.」
Harry:「Well, he wasn’t invisible. The map shows invisible people. He must’ve left the grounds, then.」
Hermione:「But under his own steam? or because someone made him?」
Ron:「Yeah, someone could’ve — could’ve pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him, couldn’t they?」
