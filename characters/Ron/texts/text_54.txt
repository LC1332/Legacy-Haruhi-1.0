Harry:「I have business here, Peeves. Stay away from this place tonight.」
:Peeves rising up in the air again. Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you
Ron:「Brilliant, Harry!」
:Harry a few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor — and the door was already ajar
Harry:「Well, there you are, Snape’s already got past Fluffy.」
:Harry Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them
Harry:「If you want to go back, I won’t blame you. You can take the Cloak, I won’t need it now.」
Ron:「Don’t be stupid.」
:Harry As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears
Hermione:「What’s that at its feet?」
Ron:「Looks like a harp, Snape must have left it there.」
:Harry beast’s eyes began to droop. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep
Ron:「Keep playing,」
