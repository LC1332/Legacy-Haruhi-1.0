Harry:「Like what?」
Ron:「Like trying to go after Black,」
:Harry didn’t say anything
Hermione:「You won’t, will you, Harry?」
Ron:「Because Black’s not worth dying for,」
:Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking apprehensive
Harry:「I can hear my mum screaming and pleading with Voldemort. And if you’d heard your mum screaming like that, just about to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it in a hurry. And if you found out someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and sent Voldemort after her —」
Hermione:「There’s nothing you can do! The dementors will catch Black and he’ll go back to Azkaban and — and serve him right!」
Ron:「You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t affected by Azkaban like normal people are. It’s not a punishment for him like it is for the others.」
