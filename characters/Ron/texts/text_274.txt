Ron:「So have I!」
:Hermione laid the things she was carrying in an empty armchair, and pulled Ron’s predictions toward her
Hermione:「Not going to have a very good month, are you?」
Ron:「Ah well, at least I’m forewarned」
Hermione:「Don’t you think it’s a bit obvious you’ve made these up?」
Ron:「How dare you! We’ve been working like house-elves here!」

:Hermione Inside were about fifty badges, all of different colors, but all bearing the same letters: S.P.E.W.
Harry:「‘Spew’? What’s this about?」
Hermione:「Not spew, It’s S-P-E-W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare」
Ron:「Never heard of it」
Hermione:「Well — if you two join — three」
Ron:「And you think we want to walk around wearing badges saying ‘spew,’ do you?」
