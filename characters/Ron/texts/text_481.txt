Hermione:「Thanks for the book, Harry! I’ve been wanting that New Theory of Numerology for ages! And that perfume is really unusual, Ron」
Ron:「No problem.」
Ron:「Who’s that for anyway?」
Hermione:「It isn’t clothes, although if I had my way I’d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom.」
Harry:「What bedroom?」
Hermione:「Well, Sirius says it’s not so much a bedroom, more a kind of — den. Apparently he sleeps under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen.」
Mrs. Weasley:「So, this is Kreacher’s bedroom?」
Ron:「Urgh.」
