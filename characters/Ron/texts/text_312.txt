Harry:「What’s up, Ron?」
Ron:「Why did I do it? I don’t know what made me do it!」
Harry:「What?」
Ginny:「He — er — just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him.」
:Ginny action
Harry:「You what?」
Ron:「I don’t know what made me do it! What was I playing at? There were people — all around — I’ve gone mad — everyone watching! I was just walking past her in the entrance hall — she was standing there talking to Diggory — and it sort of came over me — and I asked her!」
Ron:「I asked her to go with me just now, and she told me.」
Ron:「Yeah, I know! He told me after Potions! Said she’s always been really nice, helping him out with work and stuff — but she told him she was already going with someone. Ha! As if! She just didn’t want to go with Neville . . . I mean, who would?」
