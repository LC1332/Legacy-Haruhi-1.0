Harry:「Yep. And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!」
Ron:「Tonks?」
Hermione:「Tonks?」
Narrator:Ron think "If you ask me, she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry."
Hermione:「What on earth makes you say that?」
Harry:「I dunno, but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name . . . and her Patronus is a big four-legged thing now. . . . I wondered whether it hadn’t become . . . you know . . . him.」

Ron:「Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it? She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women, they’re easily upset.」
Hermione:「just forget about Malfoy」
Harry:「thwarted in attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing, and in efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn」
Hermione:「taking Ministry of Magic tests that very afternoon」
Ron:「relaxing after realizing the girl is not Lavender」
