Harry:「Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.」
Ron:「It’s not just my hand, although that feels like it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s doing this.」
Hermione:「It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday」
Ron:「Midnight on Saturday! Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.」
