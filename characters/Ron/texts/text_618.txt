Hermione:「That would be a complete waste of potion. Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The situation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit. Luck isn’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment, though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion! You’ll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him . . .」
Ron:「Couldn’t we make some more? It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in the book . . .」
Harry:「Blimey, it’s seriously complicated. And it takes six months. You’ve got to let it stew. . . .」
Ron:「Typical.」
