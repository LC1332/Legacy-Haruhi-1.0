Harry:「Why? How do you do it?」
Hermione:「Remorse. You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?」
Ron:「So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?」
Ron:「Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then. I was wondering what we were going to do with them.」
