Harry:「I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow. For me, it started there, all of it. I’ve just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.」
Ron:「Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven’t I? That’s what he wanted me to do, that’s why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right — and I’m sure he was — there are still four of them out there. I’ve got to find them and destroy them, and then I’ve got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort’s soul, the bit that’s still in his body, and I’m the one who’s going to kill him. And if I meet Severus Snape along the way, so much the better for me, so much the worse for him.」
Harry:「We’ll be there, Harry.」
Ron:「At your aunt and uncle’s house. And then we’ll go with you wherever you’re going.」
Ron:「We’re with you whatever happens. But mate, you’re going to have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we do anything else, even Godric’s Hollow.」
