Hagrid:「Hang on, there’s a spare niffler here . . . who’s missin’? Where’s Hermione?」
Ron:「She had to go to the hospital wing.」
Harry:「We’ll explain later. Pansy Parkinson was listening.」
Hagrid:「It was easily the most fun they had ever had in Care of Magical Creatures. The nifflers dived in and out of the patch of earth as though it were water, each scurrying back to the student who had released it and spitting gold into their hands. Ron’s was particularly efficient; it had soon filled his lap with coins.」
Ron:「Can you buy these as pets, Hagrid?」
