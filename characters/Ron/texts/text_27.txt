:Hermione Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape’s robes.
:Hermione Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row — Snape would never know what had happened.
Harry:「Neville, you can look!」
Ron:「It was Snape, Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his eyes off you.」
