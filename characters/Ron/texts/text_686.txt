Harry:「He’s a foreign wandmaker. He made Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.」
Ron:「But according to you, Voldemort’s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he’s already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?」
Harry:「Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better . . . or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander didn’t know.」
Hermione:「Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did, but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?」
Harry:「Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!」
Ron:「Drop it. It’s up to him. And if we’re going to the Ministry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we should go over the plan?」
