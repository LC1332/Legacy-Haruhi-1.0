Ron:「Strip it down?」
Professor McGonagall:「It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks. You will have it back if we are sure it is jinx-free.」
Harry:「There’s nothing wrong with it! Honestly, Professor —」
Professor McGonagall:「You can’t know that, Potter, not until you’ve flown it, at any rate, and I’m afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep you informed.」

Hermione:「Fine.」
Ron:「She doesn’t know, She’s just trying to get us to talk to her again.」
