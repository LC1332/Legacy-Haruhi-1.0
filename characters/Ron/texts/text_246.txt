Ron:「Look, can someone just explain what that skull thing was? It wasn’t hurting anyone. . . . Why’s it such a big deal?」
Hermione:「I told you, it’s You-Know-Who’s symbol, Ron. I read about it in The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts.」
Mr. Weasley:「And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years. Of course people panicked . . . it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.」
Ron:「I don’t get it. I mean . . . it’s still only a shape in the sky. . . .」
