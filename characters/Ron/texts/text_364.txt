Hermione:「Oh, Rita hasn’t written anything at all since the third task. As a matter of fact, Rita Skeeter isn’t going to be writing anything at all for a while. Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her.」
Ron:「What are you talking about?」
Hermione:「I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds. Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea, Harry. Did I? How? Bugging.」
Hermione:「Rita Skeeter is an unregistered Animagus. She can turn into a beetle.」
Ron:「You’re kidding. You haven’t . . . she’s not . . .」
Hermione:「Exactly. And Viktor pulled a beetle out of my hair after we’d had our conversation by the lake. And unless I’m very much mistaken, Rita was perched on the windowsill of the Divination class the day your scar hurt. She’s been buzzing around for stories all year.」
Ron:「When we saw Malfoy under that tree . . .」
