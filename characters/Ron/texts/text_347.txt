Harry:「What’s the matter? Wrong flavor?」
Ron:「Why didn’t you tell me about the gold?」
Harry:「What gold?」
Ron:「The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup, The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn’t you tell me it disappeared?」
Ron:「Must be nice, To have so much money you don’t notice if a pocketful of Galleons goes missing.」
Hermione:「It’s rubbish.」
Ron:「I don’t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a niffler.」
Hermione:「I want to know how she’s listening into private conversations when she’s supposed to be banned from the grounds!」
Hermione:「Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak! Moody says he didn’t see her anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!」
Ron:「Hermione, is there any point in telling you to drop this?」
Ron:「Bugged? What . . . put fleas on her or something?」
