Harry:「He’s gone!」
Ron:「Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day. He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six of her . . . do you want it? You can start collecting.」
Ron:「Help yourself. But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.」
Ron:「Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.」
Unknown:「Yes, well, if you see him . . .」
Ron:「Don’t know why he’s so bothered. If I’d brought a toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can’t talk.」
Ron:「We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it.」
