Hermione:「Come on, we’ll be the only ones left here if you don’t move.」
Fred Weasley:「Who’s this impartial judge who’s going to decide who the champions are?」
Fred Weasley:「Dunno, but it’s them we’ll have to fool. I reckon a couple of drops of Aging Potion might do it, George. . . .」
Ron:「Dumbledore knows you’re not of age, though.」
Fred Weasley:「Yeah, but he’s not the one who decides who the champion is, is he? Sounds to me like once this judge knows who wants to enter, he’ll choose the best from each school and never mind how old they are. Dumbledore’s trying to stop us giving our names.」
Hermione:「People have died, though!」
Fred:「Yeah, but that was years ago, wasn’t it? Anyway, where’s the fun without a bit of risk? Hey, Ron, what if we find out how to get ’round Dumbledore? Fancy entering?」
Ron:「What d’you reckon? Be cool to enter, wouldn’t it? But I s’pose they might want someone older. . . . Dunno if we’ve learned enough. . . .」
