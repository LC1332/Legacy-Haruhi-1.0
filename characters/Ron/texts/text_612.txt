Hermione:「We’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all — Aragog’s dead. If it were a question of saving him —」
Ron:「You didn’t meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot」
Hermione:「Harry, you can’t be thinking of going. It’s such a pointless thing to get detention for」
Harry:「I s’pose Hagrid’ll have to bury Aragog without us」
Hermione:「Potions will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests. . . . Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then!」
Ron:「get lucky!」
Ron:「What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?」
Harry:「Wha — ? Yeah, of course. Well . . . okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.」
Hermione:「That’s decided, then. Destination . . . determination . . . deliberation . . .」
Ron:「Oh, stop that. I feel sick enough as it is — quick, hide me!」
