Harry:「’Course she did, She can’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring., She wants a new angle, Hagrid, She should’ve interviewed Snape, ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .’, Cheers, Hagrid, You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?, No one, yet, said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject., It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn’t know, never having had access to a wizard’s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group., It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy’s cauldron-bottom report., Evil, he is, Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room. Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying., It’s Christmas, Hermione, Like what?, That egg!, Hermione hissed.」
Ron:「She wants a new angle, Hagrid, She should’ve interviewed Snape, ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .’, She should’ve interviewed Snape, said Harry grimly. He’d give her the goods on me any day. ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .’, You were supposed to say Harry’s a mad delinquent!, You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?, That egg!, Hermione hissed., Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying., Mmm . . . you’re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?, It’s Christmas, Hermione」
