Dumbledore:「Please explain why you did this. It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the disappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles.」
Ron:「We’ll go and get our stuff, said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.」
Professor McGonagall:「What are you talking about, Weasley? barked Professor McGonagall.」
Ron:「Well, you’re expelling us, aren’t you? said Ron.」
