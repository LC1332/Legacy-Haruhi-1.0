Harry:「“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.”」
Ron:「“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren’t you eating anything?”」

Ron:「Do you think this mirror shows the future?」
