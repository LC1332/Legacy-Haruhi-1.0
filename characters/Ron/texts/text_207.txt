Harry:「I’m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the execution of a mad hippogriff. As I needed to visit Hogwarts to check on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.」
Ron:「Does that mean the appeal’s already happened?」
Fudge:「No, no, it’s scheduled for this afternoon. Then you might not have to witness an execution at all! The hippogriff might get off!」
Ancient Wizard:「Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this. . . . Two o’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?」
:Black-mustached Man fingering something in his belt; running one broad thumb along the blade of a shining axe
Ron:「Why’d you stop me? Did you see them? They’ve even got the axe ready! This isn’t justice!」
