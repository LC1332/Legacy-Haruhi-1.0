Harry:「Why do they have to move in packs?” Harry asked Ron as a dozen or so girls walked past them, sniggering and staring at Harry. “How’re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?”」
Ron:「Lasso one?” Ron suggested. “Got any idea who you’re going to try?”」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry didn’t answer. He knew perfectly well whom he’d like to ask, but working up the nerve was something else. . . . Cho was a year older than he was; she was very pretty; she was a very good Quidditch player, and she was also very popular."
Ron:「Listen, you’re not going to have any trouble. You’re a champion. You’ve just beaten a Hungarian Horntail. I bet they’ll be queuing up to go with you.」
Ron:「She was quite good-looking,” said Ron fairly, after he’d stopped laughing.」
