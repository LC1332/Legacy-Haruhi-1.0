Hermione:「It — it wasn’t stealing! They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn’t want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it much harder to —」
Ron:「Get to the point!」
Hermione:「Well . . . it was easy. I just did a Summoning Charm. You know — Accio. And — they zoomed out of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.」
Harry:「But when did you do this?」
Hermione:「Just after his — Dumbledore’s — funeral. Right after we agreed we’d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it — it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . . so I tried . . . and it worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I — I packed them.」
Hermione:「I can’t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?」
Ron:「Can you hear us complaining? Where are these books anyway?」
