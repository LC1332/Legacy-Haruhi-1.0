Wood:「Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out!」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goalposts; he outstripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand. The team cheered madly. Harry let the Snitch go again, gave it a minute’s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell’s knee, looped her easily, and caught it again. It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their best moves faultlessly, and by the time they hit the ground again, Wood didn’t have a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, was a first. I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow! Not unless — Harry, you’ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven’t you? Yeah, The dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore’d go ballistic, Well, let’s hope not, Anyway — good work, everyone. Let’s get back to the tower . . . turn in early — I’m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,"
Ron:「Here you go, Get out of here! Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized a stone lying on the grass, but before he could do anything else, Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail. See? Ron said furiously, chucking the stone down again. She’s still letting him wander about wherever he wants — probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now. . . ., Did you see his face? said Ron gleefully, looking back at Malfoy. He can’t believe it! This is brilliant!」
