Ron:「He knows where he’s sleeping, in my room, he slept there last —」
Hermione:「We can all go.」

Ron:「Mum found this stack of order forms when she was cleaning Fred and George’s room, Great long price lists for stuff they’ve invented. Joke stuff, you know. Fake wands and trick sweets, loads of stuff. It was brilliant, I never knew they’d been inventing all that . . .」
