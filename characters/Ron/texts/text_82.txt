McGonagall:「You’d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you’re bleeding.」
Ron:「Not much.」
Ron:「Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted —」
McGonagall:「And speaking of Gryffindor —」
Harry:「Professor, when we took the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor shouldn’t really have points taken from it — should it?」
McGonagall:「I will not take any points from Gryffindor. But you will both get a detention.」
McGonagall:「You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory. I must also return to the feast.」
Ron:「I thought we’d had it.」
Harry:「We’ll have to watch our step from now on, though. Wish we could’ve gone up to the feast. . . .」
Ron:「She didn’t want us showing off. Doesn’t want people to think it’s clever, arriving by flying car.」
Hermione:「You’re not telling me you did fly here?」
Ron:「Skip the lecture, and tell us the new password.」
