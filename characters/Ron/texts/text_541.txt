Hermione:「That gives you equal status with prefects! You can use our special bathroom now and everything!」
Ron:「Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these, Harry, this is so cool, you’re my Captain — if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .」
Mrs. Weasley:「We’ll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn’t have to go into work again. I’m not going there without him.」
Ron:「Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know-Who’s going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?」
Mrs. Weasley:「Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide you’re too immature to come with us! And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!」
Ron:「Blimey . . . you can’t even make a joke round here anymore. . . .」
