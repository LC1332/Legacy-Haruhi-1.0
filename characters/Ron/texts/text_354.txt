Hermione:「Harry, I don’t understand it either. I just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don’t like it. . . . Moody’s right — Sirius is right — you’ve got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you’re not going to go sneaking off alone again.」
Narrator:Harry think "The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron’s and Hermione’s part."
Ron:「Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris? Let’s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he’d do anything to help you. I’m not complaining or anything, but I’m aching all over. . . .」
Hermione:「Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you! Just try and fall backward!」
Ron:「Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, Hermione! Why don’t you take a turn?」
