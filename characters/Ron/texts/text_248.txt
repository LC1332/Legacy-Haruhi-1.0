Harry:「I told Sirius about my scar, I’m waiting for his answer.」
Ron:「Good thinking! I bet Sirius’ll know what to do!」
Harry:「I hoped he’d get back to me quickly.」
Hermione:「But we don’t know where Sirius is . . . he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn’t he? Hedwig’s not going to manage that journey in a few days.」
Harry:「Yeah, I know. But there was a leaden feeling in his stomach as he looked out of the window at the Hedwig-free sky.」
Ron:「Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry. Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . .」
