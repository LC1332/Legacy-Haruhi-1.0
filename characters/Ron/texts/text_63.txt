Fred:「So, does your dad know you’ve got the car?」
Ron:「Er, no, he had to work tonight. Hopefully we’ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.」
Harry:「What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?」
Ron:「He works in the most boring department, the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.」
Harry:「What happened?」
Ron:「The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was going frantic — it’s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office — and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up —」
George:「That’s the main road. We’ll be there in ten minutes. . . . Just as well, it’s getting light. . . .」
George:「We’re a little way outside the village, Ottery St. Catchpole.」
Fred:「Touchdown!」
Harry:「It’s not much.」
Ron:「It’s wonderful.」
