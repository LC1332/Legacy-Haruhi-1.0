Harry:「Ron! Ginny’s okay! I’ve got her!」
Ron:「You’re alive! I don’t believe it! What happened? How — what — where did that bird come from?」
Harry:「He’s Dumbledore’s, said Harry, squeezing through himself.」
Ron:「How come you’ve got a sword?」
Ron:「Where’s Lockhart?」
Gilderoy Lockhart:「His memory’s gone. The Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn’t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He’s a danger to himself.」
Ron:「Hello. Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it? Do you live here?」
