Harry:「Ron, how did you — What the — ?」
Ron:「All right, Harry? What’s been going on? Why haven’t you been answering my letters? I’ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you’d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles —」
Harry:「It wasn’t me — and how did he know?」
Ron:「He works for the Ministry. You know we’re not supposed to do spells outside school —」
Harry:「I told you, I didn’t — but it’ll take too long to explain now — look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won’t let me come back, and obviously I can’t magic myself out, because the Ministry’ll think that’s the second spell I’ve done in three days, so —」
Ron:「Stop gibbering. We’ve come to take you home with us.」
