Hermione:「“Just one, and that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”」
Ron:「Oh yeah, you’re right,」
Hagrid:「The library? Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?」
Harry:「Oh, we’re not working, Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.」
Hermione:「We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all, Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?」
Harry:「We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.」
Hagrid:「I’m sayin’ nothin’」
Ron:「Just have to find out for ourselves, then」
Madam Pince:「You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!」
Hermione:「You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you? And send me an owl if you find anything.」
Ron:「And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is. It’d be safe to ask them.」
