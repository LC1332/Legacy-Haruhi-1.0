Harry:「Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,」
Ron:「Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes, like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods. . . .」
Ron:「This is a gnome,」
Fred:「Pitiful, I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.」
Harry:「Wow, Harry — that must’ve been fifty feet. . . .」
George:「See, they’re not too bright. The moment they know the de-gnoming’s going on they storm up to have a look. You’d think they’d have learned by now just to stay put.」
: The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.
: Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.
Ron:「They’ll be back. They love it here. . . . Dad’s too soft with them; he thinks they’re funny. . . .」
