Neville:「Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got this one, for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.」
Ron:「Blimey, Neville, there’s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.」
Neville:「You didn’t hear her, You wouldn’t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.」
Ron:「But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener.」
