Scrimgeour:「Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?」
Ron:「Me? Not — not really . . . It was always Harry who . . .」
:Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now! sort of look
Scrimgeour:「If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions — his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects — were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?」
Ron:「I . . . dunno. I . . . when I say we weren’t close . . . I mean, I think he liked me. . . .」
Scrimgeour:「That is a valuable object. It may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?」
Ron:「Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students. Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put his Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?」
