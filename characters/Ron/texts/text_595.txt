Harry:「Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?」
Ron:「They were a birthday present! I offered you one, didn’t I? You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you? They’d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go! They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand? They were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map, they’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas, and they’re all spiked with love potion!」
