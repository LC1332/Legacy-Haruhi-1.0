Harry, Ron, Hermione:「As the next day was Saturday, most students would normally have breakfasted late. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, however, were not alone in rising much earlier than they usually did on weekends. When they went down into the entrance hall, they saw about twenty people milling around it, some of them eating toast, all examining the Goblet of Fire. It had been placed in the center of the hall on the stool that normally bore the Sorting Hat. A thin golden line had been traced on the floor, forming a circle ten feet around it in every direction.」
Ron:「Anyone put their name in yet?」
third-year girl:「All the Durmstrang lot. But I haven’t seen anyone from Hogwarts yet.」
Harry:「Bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all gone to bed. I would’ve if it had been me . . . wouldn’t have wanted everyone watching. What if the goblet just gobbed you right back out again?」
Fred:「Done it. Just taken it.」
Ron:「What?」
