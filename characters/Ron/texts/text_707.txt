Hermione:「I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back!」
Ron:「Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really —」
Hermione:「Oh, you’re sorry!」
:Hermione laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound
Ron:「You come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?」
Hermione:「I don’t care! I don’t care what he’s done! Weeks and weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew —」
Ron:「I knew you weren’t dead! Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you don’t know what it’s been like —」
Harry:「What did you say to them?」
Ron:「Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of.」
