Hermione:「I want a word with you, Harry. You shouldn’t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it’s illegal.」
Ron:「What are you going to do, turn us in?」
Hermione:「You know perfectly well what we’re talking about! You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!」
Harry:「No, I didn’t.」
Hermione:「Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!」
Harry:「I didn’t put it in! I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking. You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.」
Ron:「There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice? But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?」
