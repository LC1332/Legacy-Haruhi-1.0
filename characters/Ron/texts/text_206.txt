:Hermione action
Ron:「“Hermione?” Ron said cautiously, because she was liable to explode when interrupted these days. “Er — are you sure you’ve copied down these times right?”」
Harry:「“Is there any point asking how you’re going to sit for two exams at once?” said Harry.」
Hermione:「“No,” said Hermione shortly. “Have either of you seen my copy of Numerology and Grammatica?”」
Ron:「“Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,” said Ron, but very quietly.」
Harry:「“And they’re coming up here to do it,” said Harry, still reading from the letter. “Someone from the Ministry of Magic and — and an executioner.”」
Hermione:「“They’re bringing the executioner to the appeal! But that sounds as though they’ve already decided!”」
Ron:「“Yeah, it does,” said Harry slowly. “They can’t!” Ron howled. “I’ve spent ages reading up on stuff for him; they can’t just ignore it all!”」
