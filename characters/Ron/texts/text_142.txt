Harry:「So am I. Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested. Your dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he?」
Ron:「Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it? Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first, because Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as well!」
Hermione:「Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.」
Harry:「Excellent! So, have you got all your new books and stuff?」
Ron:「Look at this. Brand-new wand. Fourteen inches, willow, containing one unicorn tail-hair. And we’ve got all our books — What about those Monster Books, eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two.」
Ron:「What are you doing Muggle Studies for? You’re Muggle-born! Your mum and dad are Muggles! You already know all about Muggles!」
