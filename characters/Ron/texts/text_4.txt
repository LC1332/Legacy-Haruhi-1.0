Harry:「I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.」
Narrator:Malfoy think "I’d be careful if I were you, Potter. Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you."
Ron:「Say that again.」
Malfoy:「Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?」
Harry:「Unless you get out now.」
Hermione:「What has been going on?」
Narrator:Ron think "I think he’s been knocked out. No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep."
Ron:「I’ve heard of his family, They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.」
Ron:「Scabbers has been fighting, not us. Would you mind leaving while we change?」
