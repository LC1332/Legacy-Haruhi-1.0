Harry:「How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another look —」
Ron:「You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.」
Ron:「You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.」
Ron:「Don’t push me —」
Ron:「This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.」
Ron:「Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?」
Harry:「Why not?」
Ron:「I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway, you’ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can’t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?」
