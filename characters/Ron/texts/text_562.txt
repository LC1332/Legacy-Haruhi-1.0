Harry:「After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of the team and headed off toward Hagrid’s. A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagrid’s.」
Ron:「“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” Ron was saying happily. “Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of spin on it —”」
Hermione:「“Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, looking amused.」
Ron:「“I was better than that McLaggen anyway,” said Ron in a highly satisfied voice. “Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth? Looked like he’d been Confunded. . . .”」
Hermione:「“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit scary, isn’t he?”」
Ron:「Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?」
