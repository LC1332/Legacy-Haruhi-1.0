Ron:「Impossible. She can’t get any worse than she’s been already.」
Hermione:「You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her. Especially another part-human. You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze . . .」
Ron:「Aren’t we going up to North Tower? How d’you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? We’re in classroom eleven now, it was on the notice board yesterday.」
