Hermione:「We saw him in the forest just before the Dark Mark appeared, Remember?」
Ron:「Yeah, but he didn’t stay in the forest, did he? The moment we told him about the riot, he went off to the campsite.」
Hermione:「How d’you know? How d’you know where he Disapparated to?」
Ron:「Come off it, Are you saying you reckon Ludo Bagman conjured the Dark Mark?」
:Sirius action
Hermione:「When the Dark Mark had been conjured, and the elf had been discovered holding Harry’s wand, what did Crouch do?」
Harry:「Went to look in the bushes, but there wasn’t anyone else there.」
Sirius:「Of course, he’d want to pin it on anyone but his own elf . . . and then he sacked her?」
Hermione:「Yes, he sacked her, just because she hadn’t stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled —」
Ron:「Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!」
