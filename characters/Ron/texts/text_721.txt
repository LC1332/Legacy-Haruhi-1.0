Harry:「But how do you know that those wands — the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny — aren’t the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?」
Ron:「What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?」
Harry:「So why would you take the stone?」
Ron:「Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius . . . Mad-Eye . . . Dumbledore . . . my parents. . . .」
Harry:「What about the Cloak, though? Don’t you realize, he’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s. It’s infallible. We’ve never been spotted under it —」
Ron:「Of course not — we’re invisible when we’re under it, Ron! But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they’re not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It’s never occurred to me before, but I’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes in. Harry’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly new, is it, but it’s just . . . perfect!」
