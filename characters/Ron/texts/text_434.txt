Hermione:「Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you’ve got to say. Look, you know the first weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?」
Ron:「Why do we have to do it outside school?」
Hermione:「Because, I don’t think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to.」
Harry:「There was one thing worrying him. Sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of September; Harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they did not want him to come — but he still worried from time to time that Sirius might throw caution to the winds and turn up anyway. What were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in Hogsmeade, perhaps under the nose of Draco Malfoy?」
Ron:「Well, you can’t blame him for wanting to get out and about. I mean, he’s been on the run for over two years, hasn’t he, and I know that can’t have been a laugh, but at least he was free, wasn’t he? And now he’s just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf.」
