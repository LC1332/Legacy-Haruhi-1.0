Harry:「Get Fang!」
Ron:「Follow the spiders. I’ll never forgive Hagrid. We’re lucky to be alive.」
Harry:「That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.」
Ron:「What was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out, I’d like to know?」
Percy:「If you’ve finished eating, I’ll take that seat, Ginny. I’m starving, I’ve only just come off patrol duty.」
:Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away
:Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table
Ron:「She was just about to tell us something important!」
Percy:「Oh — that — that’s nothing to do with the Chamber of Secrets」
Ron:「What were you doing, Percy? Go on, tell us, we won’t laugh.」
