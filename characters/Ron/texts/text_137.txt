Fred and George:「She knew something, Harry. That’s why she was taken. It wasn’t some stupid thing about Percy at all. She’d found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That must be why she was — I mean, she was a pureblood. There can’t be any other reason.」
Ron:「Harry, D’you think there’s any chance at all she’s not — you know —」
Ron:「D’you know what? I think we should go and see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it’s a basilisk in there.」
Lockhart:「Er, well, yes. Urgent call — unavoidable — got to go —」
Ron:「What about my sister?」
