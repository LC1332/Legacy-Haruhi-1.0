Mrs. Weasley:「He’s very upset, The Ministry wants to keep Mr. Crouch’s disappearance quiet, but Percy’s been hauled in for questioning about the instructions Mr. Crouch has been sending in. They seem to think there’s a chance they weren’t genuinely written by him. Percy’s been under a lot of strain. They’re not letting him fill in for Mr. Crouch as the fifth judge tonight. Cornelius Fudge is going to be doing it.」
Ron:「What’re you doing here?」
Mrs. Weasley:「Come to watch Harry in the last task! I must say, it makes a lovely change, not having to cook. How was your exam?」
Ron:「Oh . . . okay, Couldn’t remember all the goblin rebels’ names, so I invented a few. It’s all right, they’re all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean; it wasn’t hard.」
