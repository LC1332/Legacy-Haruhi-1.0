Hermione:「It comes down to this, Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn’t looking.」
Ron:「That’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He’d done a runner.」
Harry:「He seemed really weak — I don’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.」
Hermione:「You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven’t I told you enough times?」
Ron:「Krum attacked Crouch — no, wait for it — and then Stunned himself!」
Hermione:「Well, that was his fault.」
Harry:「He was out of his mind. Half the time he seemed to think his wife and son were still alive, and he kept talking to Percy about work and giving him instructions.」
Ron:「But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. . . .」
Ron:「Maybe he didn’t want you to get there! Maybe — hang on — how fast d’you reckon he could’ve gotten down to the forest? D’you reckon he could’ve beaten you and Dumbledore there?」
