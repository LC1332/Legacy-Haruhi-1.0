Mrs. Weasley:「Yes, good point. Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?」
Ron:「Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!」
Mr. Weasley:「Don’t talk to your mother like that. And do as you’re told.」
:Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart
Narrator:Mr. Weasley think "There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly, but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius’s bike and, er, I’m hiding — that’s to say, keeping — it in here. Fantastic stuff: There’s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it’s called, the most magnificent battery, and it’ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I’m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly’s not — I mean, when I’ve got time."
:Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom
Ron:「I’m doing it, I’m doing — ! Oh, it’s you.」
Ron:「We were just talking about Mad-Eye. I reckon he might have survived.」
