Hermione:「Maybe it’s a bit like an illness, A fever or something. It has to get worse before it gets better. Dumbledore doesn’t want you to have dreams about that corridor at all, or he wouldn’t have asked Snape to teach you Occlumency. You’re just going to have to work a bit harder in your lessons. Maybe it’s not Harry’s fault he can’t close his mind. Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.」
Ron:「Maybe Snape isn’t really trying to help Harry . . . Maybe he’s actually trying to open Harry’s mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know. Maybe he’s actually trying to open Harry’s mind a bit wider . . . make it easier for You-Know. He used to be a Death Eater. And we’ve never seen proof that he really swapped sides . . . Dumbledore trusts him. And if we can’t trust Dumbledore, we can’t trust anyone.」
