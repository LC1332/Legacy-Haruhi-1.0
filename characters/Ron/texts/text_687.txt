Hermione:「Urgh. It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.」
Ron:「Yeah, but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn’t he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.」
Ron:「Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, I’m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.」
Harry:「Blimey, that’s scary.」
Hermione:「Take one of Mafalda’s tokens, and let’s go, it’s nearly nine.」
wizard:「Morning, Reg! Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry Potter?」
Ron:「Yeah, stupid, isn’t it?」
Harry:「What am I going to do?」
Ron:「If I don’t turn up, my wife — I mean, Cattermole’s wife —」
