Hermione:「We’ll have to talk to them, Ron」
Ron:「Why?」
Hermione:「Because we’re prefects! It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!」
Hermione:「Anyway, what’s up, Harry? You look really angry about something.」
Ron:「Seamus reckons Harry’s lying about You-Know-Who」
Hermione:「No, I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t noticed, we’re on your side.」
Hermione:「Don’t you remember what Dumbledore said at the end-of-term feast last year? About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust —’」
Ron:「How do you remember stuff like that?」
Ron:「And Harry said it last night, if that means we’re supposed to get matey with the Slytherins, fat chance.」
