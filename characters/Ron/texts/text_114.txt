Malfoy:「I wish I knew who it is. I could help them」
Ron:「jaw dropped」
Malfoy:「Father won’t tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing — last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it’s a matter of time before one of them’s killed this time. . . . I hope it’s Granger」
Ron:「clenching Crabbe’s gigantic fists」
Harry:「Azkaban?」
Malfoy:「Azkaban — the wizard prison, Goyle. Honestly, if you were any slower, you’d be going backward」
Harry:「Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of course, he’s got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?」
Ron:「Ho!」
