Hermione:「I’m coming with you」
Ron:「You are not」
Harry:「D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up」
Ron:「You’ve got some nerve —」
Neville:「Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.」
Harry:「How’s your arm?」
Neville:「Fine, Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.」
Neville:「Don’t leave me! I don’t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice already.」
Ron:「If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.」
Filch:「They’re in here somewhere, probably hiding.」
Harry:「RUN!」
Hermione:「I — told — you.」
Ron:「We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower, quickly as possible.」
