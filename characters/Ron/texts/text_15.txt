Malfoy:「I’d take you on anytime on my own. Tonight, if you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?」
Ron:「I’m his second, who’s yours?」
Ron:「a second’s there to take over if you die」
Hermione:「Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?」
Hermione:「I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying — Bet you could」
Hermione:「and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.」
Harry:「And it’s really none of your business」
Ron:「Good-bye」
Hermione:「I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry」
Ron:「Go back to bed!」
Hermione:「Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells」
Ron:「Go away」
