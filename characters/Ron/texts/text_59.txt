Hermione:「I’m not ill, I think it’s a warning . . . it means danger’s coming. . . .」
:Hermione spell to Neville
:Neville 
Ron:「So the Stone’s gone? Flamel’s just going to die?」
Ron:「That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was it? —‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.’」
Hermione:「I got back all right, I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.」
Ron:「D’you think he meant you to do it? Sending you your father’s Cloak and everything?」
Ron:「Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right. Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you — but the food’ll be good.」
