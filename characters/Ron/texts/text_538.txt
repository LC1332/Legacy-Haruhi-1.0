Hermione:「Nobody knows what it said, though. It got smashed.」
Ron:「Although the Prophet says —」
Hermione:「Shh!」
Harry:「The Prophet’s got it right. That glass ball that smashed wasn’t the only record of the prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’s office, he was the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what it said, it looks like I’m the one who’s got to finish off Voldemort. . . . At least, it said neither of us could live while the other survives.」
:Hermione gazed at one another in silence
Hermione:「I squeezed it and it — it punched me!」
Ron:「Mum’ll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries —」
Ron:「When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy. And we were kind of right, weren’t we? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time — he must think you’ve got a chance!」
Ron:「Can’t be long now, it’s been a month.」
