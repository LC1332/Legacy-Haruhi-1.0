Harry:「Help yourself.」
Ron:「This one’s from a bloke who thinks you’re off your rocker. Ah well . . .」
Hermione:「This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St. Mungo’s.」
Harry:「This one looks okay, though. Hey, she says she believes me!」
Fred:「This one’s in two minds. Says you don’t come across as a mad person, but he really doesn’t want to believe You-Know-Who’s back so he doesn’t know what to think now. . . . Blimey, what a waste of parchment . . .」
Hermione:「Here’s another one you’ve convinced, Harry! ‘Having read your side of the story I am forced to the conclusion that the Daily Prophet has treated you very unfairly. . . . Little though I want to think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has returned, I am forced to accept that you are telling the truth . . .’ Oh this is wonderful!」
Ron:「Another one who thinks you’re barking, but this one says you’ve got her converted, and she now thinks you’re a real hero — she’s put in a photograph too — wow —」
