Hermione:「’Course not, he’ll recover,」
Ron:「Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn’t it?」
Harry:「Reparo! That’s all very well, but what if Montague’s permanently injured?」
Hermione:「Who cares? Montague shouldn’t have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!」
Ron:「You? Why should I be worried about you?」
Hermione:「Well, if she does say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done anything! But I’m sure she won’t, I mean, if it’s really true they’ve got premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for ages . . .」
Ron:「Yeah, but that’s another thing, how did they get premises? It’s a bit dodgy, isn’t it? They’ll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley, she’ll want to know what they’ve been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold . . .」
