Ron:「I reckon you’re cracking up. You’re trying to do too much.」
Hermione:「No, I’m not! I just made a mistake, that’s all! I’d better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry. . . . I’ll see you in Divination!」
:Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawney’s classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed
Hermione:「I can’t believe I missed Cheering Charms! And I bet they come up in our exams; Professor Flitwick hinted they might!」
:Harry and Ron climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower room
Ron:「I thought we weren’t starting crystal balls until next term」
