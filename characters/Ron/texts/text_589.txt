Harry:「confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him」
Ron:「thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all」
Hermione:「refused to remain in Ron’s presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look」
Ron:「said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of fried egg. “Won’t refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.”」
Hermione:「said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone and ankle-deep in snow.」
Ron:「looked at Hermione’s haughty profile and muttered to Harry, "What’ve you done?"」
