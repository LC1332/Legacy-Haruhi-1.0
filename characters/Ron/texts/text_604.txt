Harry:「How good’s this? We know where Malfoy’s going! We’ve got him cornered now!」
Ron:「Yeah, it’s great.」
Hermione:「But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of students’? How many people are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s doing. . . .」
Harry:「Yeah, that is weird. I heard him telling Crabbe it wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all these . . . all these . . .」
Harry:「God, I’ve been stupid. It’s obvious, isn’t it? There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon. . . . He could’ve nicked some any time during that lesson. . . .」
Ron:「Nicked what?」
