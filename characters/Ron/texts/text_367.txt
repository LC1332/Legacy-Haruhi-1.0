Harry:「So why’s Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark? Did you — er — bother to ask him at all?」
Ron:「We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on. We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen him twice since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted —」
Harry:「He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to」
Hermione:「I thought that too. But he didn’t want you to know anything.」
Harry:「Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted」
Ron:「Don’t be thick」
Ron:「Mum won’t let us near the meetings, she says we’re too young —」
