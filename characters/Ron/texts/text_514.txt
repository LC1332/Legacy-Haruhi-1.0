Hermione:「er . . . how . . . how did Voldemort get into the Ministry of Magic without anybody realizing he was there? Harry . . . they’re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world. . . . You think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected? You’ve dreamed about the place, that’s all. But this is just — just so unlikely! why on earth would Voldemort want to use Sirius to get the weapon, or whatever the thing is? This isn’t a criticism, Harry! But you do . . . sort of . . . I mean — don’t you think you’ve got a bit of a — a — saving-people-thing? I mean . . . last year, for instance . . . in the lake . . . during the Tournament . . . you shouldn’t have . . . I mean, you didn’t need to save that little Delacour girl. . . . You got a bit . . . carried away . . .」
Ron:「G-get there? But — Harry . . . Harry, think about this, it’s five o’clock in the afternoon. . . . The Ministry of Magic must be full of workers. . . . How would Voldemort and Sirius have got in without being seen? Harry . . . they’re probably the two most wanted wizards in the world. . . . You think they could get into a building full of Aurors undetected? He’s got a point. Sirius’s brother was a Death Eater, wasn’t he? Maybe he told Sirius the secret of how to get the weapon! Look, I’m sorry, but neither of you are making sense, and we’ve got no proof for any of this, no proof Voldemort and Sirius are even there — Hermione, Harry’s seen them!」
