Hermione:「Maybe your dad did use it, Harry, but he’s not the only one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you’ve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless.」
Ron:「That was different. They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh.」
Hermione:「I just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!」
Harry:「If he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?」
Hermione:「The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough pure-blood wizards left. I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.」
Ron:「My whole family are blood traitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!」
