Hermione:「Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all dangerous to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.」
Ron:「But even if we wreck the thing it lives in, why can’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?」
Hermione:「Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.」
Harry:「Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.」
Ron:「Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure.」
Harry:「That diary sort of died when I stabbed it. And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.」
Ron:「The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?」
