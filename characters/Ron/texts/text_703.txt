Harry:「Oh, remembered me, have you?」
Ron:「You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.」
Harry:「What’s the problem?」
Ron:「Problem? There’s no problem,」
Harry:「I don’t know? I don’t know?」
Harry:「It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here, you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something.」
Hermione:「Ron,」
Ron:「I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,」
Ron:「We thought you knew what you were doing! We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!」
Ron:「Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!」
