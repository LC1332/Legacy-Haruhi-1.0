Harry:「He’s not, I asked,」
Ron:「Maybe Percy’s poisoning him. Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he’ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.」
Hermione:「Funny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They’d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.」
Harry:「Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though. Maybe they need an interpreter.」
Ron:「Worrying about poor ’ickle goblins, now, are you? Thinking of starting up S.P.U.G. or something? Society for the Protection of Ugly Goblins?」
Ron:「No.」
