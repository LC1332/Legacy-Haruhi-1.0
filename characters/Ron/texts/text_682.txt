Harry:「There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house, more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express.」
Ron:「I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn’t it?」
Hermione:「I remembered this.」
Hermione:「Phineas Nigellus.」
Hermione:「Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him, But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside of my handbag.」
Ron:「Good thinking!」
:Ron nodded his appreciation of this news
Ron:「Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance.」
Hermione:「But you never told us that!」
:Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen.
Hermione:「There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!」
Ron:「Well, does it really matter?」
