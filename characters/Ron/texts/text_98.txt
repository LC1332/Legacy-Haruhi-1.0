Percy:「That’s a girls’ bathroom! What were you — ?」
Ron:「Just having a look around, Clues, you know —」
Percy:「That’s what I told Ginny, but she still seems to think you’re going to be expelled, I’ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business —」
Ron:「You don’t care about Ginny, You’re just worried I’m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy —」
