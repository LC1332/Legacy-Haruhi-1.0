Harry:「Well, why not? Why not? It was a stone, wasn’t it? What if it was the Resurrection Stone?」
Ron:「Blimey — but would it still work if Dumbledore broke — ?」
Harry:「Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!」
Hermione:「Harry, you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story —」
Harry:「Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!」
Hermione:「A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!」
Ron:「Where d’you reckon the ring is now? What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?」
Hermione:「Harry」
Harry:「Read it. Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!」
Narrator:Harry think "IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring — it’s in the Snitch!"
Ron:「You — you reckon?」
