Xenophilius:「Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She . . . she will like to see you. I’ll go and call her and then — yes, very well. I shall try to help you.」
Ron:「Cowardly old wart. Luna’s got ten times his guts.」
Harry:「He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here.」
Hermione:「Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.」
Harry:「Look at this.」
Ron:「Fetching, Surprised he didn’t wear that to the wedding.」
