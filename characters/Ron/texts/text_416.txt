Ron:「“I mean, we can do it tonight,” said Ron, as he and Harry walked down the sloping lawns toward the Quidditch pitch, their broomsticks over their shoulders, Hermione’s dire warnings that they would fail all their O.W.L.s still ringing in their ears. “And we’ve got tomorrow. She gets too worked up about work, that’s her trouble . . .” There was a pause and he added, in a slightly more anxious tone, “D’you think she meant it when she said we weren’t copying from her?”」
Harry:「“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. “Still, this is important too, we’ve got to practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team . . .”」
Ron:「“Yeah, that’s right,” said Ron in a heartened tone. “And we have got plenty of time to do it all . . .”」
George:「“All right, Ron?” said George, winking at him.」
Ron:「“Yeah,” said Ron, who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch.」
