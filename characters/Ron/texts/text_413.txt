Ron:「What are you looking so pleased about?」
Harry:「Erm . . . Quidditch later.」
Ron:「Listen . . . you don’t fancy going out a bit earlier with me, do you? Just to — er — give me some practice before training? So I can, you know, get my eye in a bit . . .」
Ron:「“Anything interesting?”」
Harry:「“Wait a moment,” said Hermione suddenly. “Oh no . . . Sirius!”」
Harry:「“What’s happened?”」
Hermione:「“‘The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black, notorious mass murderer . . . blah blah blah . . . is currently hiding in London!’” Hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper.」
Harry:「“Lucius Malfoy, I’ll bet anything,” said Harry in a low, furious voice. “He did recognize Sirius on the platform . . .”」
Ron:「“What?” said Ron, looking alarmed. “You didn’t say —”」
