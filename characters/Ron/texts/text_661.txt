Hermione:「“We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ —”」
Ron:「“What’s that, an illness?”」
Hermione:「“So these are children’s stories?”」
Ron:「“Yeah, I mean, that’s just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like in the original versions.”」
Hermione:「“All the same, we should get to bed. It wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.”」
Ron:「“A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding. I’ll get the lights.”」
