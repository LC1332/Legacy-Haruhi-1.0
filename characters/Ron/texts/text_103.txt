Hermione:「How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?, Anyone can make a mistake, And it doesn’t hurt anymore, does it, Harry?」
Ron:「If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked., That was some catch you made. Malfoy’s face . . . he looked ready to kill. . . ., I want to know how he fixed that Bludger, I hope it tastes better than this stuff. . . ., If it’s got bits of Slytherins in it? You’ve got to be joking, Unbelievable flying, Harry, Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn’t seem too happy.」
