Harry:「Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus’s bedroom door. Neither worked. He handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more successful at opening it than he had been.」
Ron:「Can you feel it, though?」
Harry:「What d’you mean?」
Ron:「Was it his own blood pulsing through his veins that he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart?」
