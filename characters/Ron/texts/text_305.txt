Dobby:「Dobby is going to buy a sweater next, Harry Potter!」
Ron:「Tell you what, Dobby, I’ll give you the one my mum knits me this Christmas, I always get one from her. You don’t mind maroon, do you?」
:Dobby Dobby is delighted.
Ron:「We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you, but it’ll go well with your tea cozy.」
Dobby:「Harry Potter . . . can Dobby come and see you sometimes, sir?」
Harry:「’Course you can.」
Ron:「All these years I’ve been really impressed with Fred and George, nicking food from the kitchens — well, it’s not exactly difficult, is it? They can’t wait to give it away!」
Hermione:「Oh she’ll cheer up, Once the shock’s worn off, and she’s got used to Hogwarts, she’ll see how much better off she is without that Crouch man.」
Ron:「She seems to love him. Doesn’t think much of Bagman, though, does she? Wonder what Crouch says at home about him?」
