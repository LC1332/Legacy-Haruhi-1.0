Hagrid:「Well, we waited till morning, didn’ want ter go sneakin’ up on ’em in the dark, fer our own safety. ’Bout three in the mornin’ they fell asleep jus’ where they was sittin’. We didn’ dare sleep. Fer one thing, we wanted ter make sure none of ’em woke up an’ came up where we were, an’ fer another, the snorin’ was unbelievable. Caused an avalanche near mornin’. Anyway, once it was light we wen’ down ter see ’em.」
Ron:「Just like that? You just walked right into a giant camp?」
Hagrid:「Well, Dumbledore’d told us how ter do it. Give the Gurg gifts, show some respect, yeh know.」
Harry:「Give the what gifts?」
Hagrid:「Oh, the Gurg — means the chief.」
Ron:「How could you tell which one was the Gurg?」
