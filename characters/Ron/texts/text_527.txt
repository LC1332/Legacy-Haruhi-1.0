Ginny:「Oh, he just says it was a really good bit of magic.」
Ron:「I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George. They sent me all these, you know. Must be doing all right out of that joke shop, eh?」
Hermione:「So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore’s back?」
Neville:「Yes, everything’s settled right back down again.」
Ron:「I s’pose Filch is happy, is he?」
Ginny:「Sulking, more like.」
Ron:「Yeah, she shows signs of life if you do this.」
Hermione:「Speaking of centaurs, who’s Divination teacher now? Is Firenze staying?」
Harry:「He’s got to, the other centaurs won’t take him back, will they?」
Ginny:「It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach.」
Ron:「Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for good. Mind you, the whole subject’s useless if you ask me, Firenze isn’t a lot better . . .」
