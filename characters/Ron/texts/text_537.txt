Harry:「What’s this?」
Ron:「Dunno, but if Fred and George’ve left it here, it’s probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.」
Harry:「Your mum said the shop’s going well. Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business.」
Ron:「That’s an understatement. They’re raking in the Galleons! I can’t wait to see the place, we haven’t been to Diagon Alley yet, because Mum says Dad’s got to be there for extra security and he’s been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.」
Harry:「But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back —」
Hermione:「Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right. I heard him telling your mum, Ron.」
Ron:「Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say.」
Harry:「I only just remembered. He told me last night in your broom shed.」
Ron:「Blimey . . . private lessons with Dumbledore! I wonder why he’s . . . ?」
