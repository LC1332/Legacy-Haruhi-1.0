Lupin:「Very well, Stand aside, Harry, I’m going to tie him up, That’s all, I swear, Ron, I can’t mend bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’s best if we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital wing, There’s nothing seriously wrong with him, You were just a little — overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er — perhaps it will be best if we don’t revive him until we’re safely back in the castle. We can take him like this. . . .」
Ron:「That’s better, Thanks, And me」
