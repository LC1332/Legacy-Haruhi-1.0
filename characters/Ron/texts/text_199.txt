Hermione:「Malfoy’s dad’s frightened the Committee into it, You know what he’s like. They’re a bunch of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There’ll be an appeal, though, there always is. Only I can’t see any hope. . . . .Nothing will have changed.」
Ron:「Yeah, it will, You won’t have to do all the work alone this time, Hermione. I’ll help.」
Hermione:「Ron, I’m really, really sorry about Scabbers . . . . ,」
Ron:「Oh — well — he was old, And he was a bit useless. You never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.」
Narrator:Hagrid think "That Committee’s in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket. I’m jus’ gonna make sure the rest o’ Beaky’s time is the happiest he’s ever had. I owe him that. . . ."
Malfoy:「Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic? And he’s supposed to be our teacher!」
Hermione:「Don’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —」
Ron:「Hermione!」
