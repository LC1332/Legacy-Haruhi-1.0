Kreacher:「Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner.」
Ron:「No!」
Hermione:「SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER」
Narrator:Hermione think "‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. ‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values —’ Like committing murder and cutting off people’s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s study — Merlin’s pants!” she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!”"
Ron:「‘Merlin’s pants’? She must be upset.」
