:Hermione It hasn’t really started yet, sighed Hermione gloomily, folding up the newspaper again. But it won’t be long now . . .
Ron:「Hey, Harry, nodding toward the glass window onto the corridor」
:Harry looked around
:Cho passing, accompanied by Marietta Edgecombe, who was wearing a balaclava
:Harry Cho’s eyes met for a moment
:Cho blushed and kept walking
:Harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawns chased off its square by Ron’s knight
Ron:「What’s — er — going on with you and her anyway?」
Narrator:Harry think "Wanting to impress Cho seemed to belong to a past that was no longer quite connected with him. So much of what he had wanted before Sirius’s death felt that way these days. . . . The week that had elapsed since he had last seen Sirius seemed to have lasted much, much longer: It stretched across two universes, the one with Sirius in it, and the one without."
Ron:「You’re well out of it, mate. I mean, she’s quite good-looking and all that, but you want someone a bit more cheerful.」
