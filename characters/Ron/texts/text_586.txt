Harry:「If you ask that once more, I’m going to stick this sprout —」
Ron:「I’m only checking!」
Harry:「Yes, Snape was offering to help him! He said he’d promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Unbreakable Oath or something —」
Ron:「An Unbreakable Vow? Nah, he can’t have. . . . Are you sure?」
Harry:「I’d worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. What happens if you break it, then?」
:Ron 
Ron:「Gits, Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone too.」
Harry:「Yep, I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.」
Ron:「Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though.」
Harry:「They didn’t hear him, No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape.」
Ron:「Yeah . . . I’m just saying, though.」
