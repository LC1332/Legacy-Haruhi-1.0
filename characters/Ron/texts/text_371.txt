Harry:「Couldn’t Percy do that?」
Ron:「Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad, Why not?」
Fred:「Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying.」
Ginny:「It’s been awful.」
George:「I think we’re well shut of him.」
Harry:「What’s happened?」
Fred:「Percy and Dad had a row, I’ve never seen Dad row with anyone like that. It’s normally Mum who shouts . . .」
Ron:「It was the first week back after term ended, We were about to come and join the Order. Percy came home and told us he’d been promoted.」
