Sirius:「Oh I know Crouch all right. He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial.」
Ron:「You’re kidding!」
Hermione:「You’re kidding!」
Sirius:「No, I’m not. Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know?」
Harry:「He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic.」
Sirius:「He’s a great wizard, Barty Crouch, powerfully magical — and power-hungry. Oh never a Voldemort supporter. No, Barty Crouch was always very outspoken against the Dark Side. But then a lot of people who were against the Dark Side . . . well, you wouldn’t understand . . . you’re too young.」
Ron:「That’s what my dad said at the World Cup. Try us, why don’t you?」
