Professor McGonagall:「But I don’t say so. The form clearly states that the parent or guardian must give permission. I’m sorry, Potter, but that’s my final word. You had better hurry, or you’ll be late for your next lesson.」
Ron:「There’s always the feast, You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.」
Harry:「Yeah, great.」
Percy:「They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. All right, the sweetshop’s rather good, and Zonko’s Joke Shop’s frankly dangerous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really, Harry, apart from that, you’re not missing anything.」
Hermione:「We’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,」
Ron:「Yeah, loads,」
