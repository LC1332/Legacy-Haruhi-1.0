Dumbledore:「I would like you to wear your Cloak, please. Very good. Shall we go? That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink, I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the Hog’s Head . . . or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of disguising one’s true destination. You can Apparate now, I believe? No matter, I can assist you again.」
Ron:「Er — why do I need socks? Thanks. Say good-bye to her for me.」
