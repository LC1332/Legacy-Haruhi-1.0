Hermione:「Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?」
Ron:「Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.」
Harry:「Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,」
Ron:「“But it’s against our laws, Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.”」
