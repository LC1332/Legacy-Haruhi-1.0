Peeves:「AHA! Potty asked Loony to go to the party! Potty lurves Loony! Potty luuuuurves Looooooony! Nice to keep these things private. And sure enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn’s party.」
Ron:「You could’ve taken anyone! Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood? Don’t call her that, Ron. What did you have to imitate her for? She laughed at my mustache! So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen. You could say sorry.」
