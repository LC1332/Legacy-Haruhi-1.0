Hermione:「Maybe . . . maybe it’s something you need to find out for yourself,」
Ron:「that makes sense.」
Hermione:「but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know about this!」
Ron:「I think we should vote on it, Those in favor of going to see Lovegood —」
Harry:「You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.」
Ron:「All’s fair in love and war, and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!」
Hermione:「Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there for Christmas.」
Ron:「I wasn’t at the Burrow! Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would’ve been great about it. And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.」
Ron:「Let’s try up here,」
Ron:「Aha! That’s got to be Luna’s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!」
