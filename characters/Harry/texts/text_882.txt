Hermione:「Good one . . . don’t forget the signal . . .」
Harry:「What’s the signal?」
Hermione:「A loud chorus of ‘Weasley Is Our King’ if they see Umbridge coming,」
:Harry inserted the blade of Sirius’s knife in the crack between door and wall. The lock clicked open, and they entered the office.
:Harry dashed over to the fireplace, seized the pot of Floo powder, and threw a pinch into the grate, causing emerald flames to burst into life there. He knelt down quickly, thrust his head into the dancing fire, and cried, “Number twelve, Grimmauld Place!”
:Kreacher came creeping into view. He looked highly delighted about something, though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hands, which were heavily bandaged.
Kreacher:「It’s the Potter boy’s head in the fire, What has he come for, Kreacher wonders?」
Harry:「Where’s Sirius, Kreacher?」
Kreacher:「Nobody here but Kreacher!」
Harry:「What about Lupin? Mad-Eye? Any of them, are any of them here?」
