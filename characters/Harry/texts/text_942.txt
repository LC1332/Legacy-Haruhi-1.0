Hermione:「That’s not fair. She still hasn’t got over what happened . . . you know . . . I mean, he was her cousin!」
Harry:「Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other! Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met —」
Hermione:「That’s not the point. She thinks it was her fault he died!」
Harry:「How does she work that one out?」
Hermione:「It’s survivor’s guilt. I know Lupin’s tried to talk her round, but she’s still really down. She’s actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing!」
Hermione:「She can’t change her appearance like she used to. I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something.」
Harry:「I didn’t know that could happen.」
Ginny:「Now!」
Ginny:「You lot had better come down quickly too.」
Harry:「What’s this?」
