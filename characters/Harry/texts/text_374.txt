Harry:「Sorry?」
Hermione:「They must go to Beauxbatons. You know . . . Beauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . I read about it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe.」

Harry:「Ah, no, I don’t believe it . . . I’ve lost my wand!」
Hermione:「Maybe it fell out of your pocket when we were running?」
Harry:「Yeah, maybe . . .」
