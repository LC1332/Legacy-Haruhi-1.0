Hermione:「You saw the what?」
:Ron saw the doe first
Harry:「They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep her limbs locked together.」
Hermione:「But it must have been a Patronus! Couldn’t you see who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can’t believe this! Then what happened?」
Narrator:Ron think "Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool and had waited for him to resurface; how he had realized that something was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in."
Harry:「— and Ron stabbed it with the sword.」
Harry:「Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare wand?」
