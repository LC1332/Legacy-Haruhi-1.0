Mrs. Weasley:「Close the door, please, Harry.」
Harry:「Feeling Mrs. Weasley’s eyes on the back of his head, Harry regretfully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party.」
Mrs. Weasley:「Right, you lot, you need to be careful, because doxies bite and their teeth are poisonous. I’ve got a bottle of antidote here, but I’d rather nobody needed it.」
Mrs. Weasley:「When I say the word, start spraying immediately. They’ll come flying out at us, I expect, but it says on the sprays one good squirt will paralyze them. When they’re immobilized, just throw them in this bucket.」
Harry:「All right — squirt!」
