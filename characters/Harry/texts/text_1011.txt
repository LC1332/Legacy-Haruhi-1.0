Hermione:「Pass me a bowl」
Harry:「Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best when they’re fresh!」
Hermione:「Anyway, Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come.」
Harry:「groaned」
Ron:「And this is another party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?」
Hermione:「Look, I didn’t make up the name ‘Slug Club’ —」
Ron:「‘Slug Club.’ It’s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug —」
Hermione:「We’re allowed to bring guests, and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!」
Harry:「wished the pod had flown a little farther」
