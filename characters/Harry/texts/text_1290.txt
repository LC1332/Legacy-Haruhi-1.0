Ron:「Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s.」
Harry:「What do you think?」
Hermione:「Oh, Harry, it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This can’t be what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time.」
Ron:「I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks.」
Harry:「You don’t believe it either?」
Ron:「One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.’ ‘Wand of elder, never prosper.’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.」
Hermione:「Harry and I were raised by Muggles. We were taught different superstitions. I think you’re right. It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose —」
Hermione:「The Cloak,」
Ron:「the wand,」
Harry:「the stone.」
