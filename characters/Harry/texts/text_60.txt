Ron:「Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.」
Harry:「Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him,」
Ron:「“But it’s against our laws, Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.”」
Harry:「“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?”」
Hagrid:「“Who is it?”」
:Hagrid shut the door quickly
:Hagrid stifling hot inside, blazing fire in the grate
:Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches
Harry:「“Yes, We were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy.”」
