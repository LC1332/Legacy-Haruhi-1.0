Dobby:「Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby, no he won’t, or Dobby will shut Kreacher’s mouth for him! — Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and what a master he is, filthy friend of Mudbloods, oh, what would poor Kreacher’s mistress say — ? — Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do! — Dobby would be honored to help Harry Potter!」
Harry:「What’ve you done to him? — Nice one — I’m forbidding you to fight each other! Well, Kreacher, you’re forbidden to fight Dobby. Dobby, I know I’m not allowed to give you orders — Yeah, I did — I’ve got a job for you. — Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you — I want you to tail Draco Malfoy. I want to know where he’s going, who he’s meeting, and what he’s doing. I want you to follow him around the clock. — There won’t be any need for that.」
