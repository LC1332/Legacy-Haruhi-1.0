Hermione:「What does it feel like?」
Narrator:Harry think "an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all . . . and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy. . . ."
Harry:「Excellent. Really excellent. Right . . . I’m going down to Hagrid’s.」
Ron and Hermione:「No, Harry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?」
Harry:「No, I’m going to Hagrid’s, I’ve got a good feeling about going to Hagrid’s.」
Ron and Hermione:「No, both looking positively alarmed now.」
Hermione:「This is Felix Felicis, I suppose? You haven’t got another little bottle full of — I don’t know —」
Ron:「Essence of Insanity?」
Harry:「Trust me, I know what I’m doing . . . or at least — Felix does.」
