Lucius Malfoy:「The Minister was just telling me about your lucky escape, Potter, Quite astonishing, the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight holes. . . . Snakelike, in fact . . .」
:Mr. Weasley gripped Harry’s shoulder in warning
Harry:「Yeah, yeah, I’m good at escaping . . .」
Lucius Malfoy:「And Arthur Weasley too! What are you doing here, Arthur?」
Mr. Weasley:「I work here.」
Lucius Malfoy:「Not here, surely? I thought you were up on the second floor. . . . Don’t you do something that involves sneaking Muggle artifacts home and bewitching them?」
Mr. Weasley:「No.」
Harry:「What are you doing here anyway?」
Harry:「Why wasn’t he waiting outside Fudge’s office if they’ve got business to do together? What was he doing down here?」
