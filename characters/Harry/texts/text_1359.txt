Professor Sprout:「I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House, Tentacula. Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff pods . . . yes, I’d like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.」

Harry:「Professor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?」
Flitwick:「— Protego Horribilis — the diadem of Ravenclaw? A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!」
Harry:「I only meant — do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?」
