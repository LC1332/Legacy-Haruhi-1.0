Ron:「He — he can’t be near us now, can he?」
Harry:「No, he’s probably miles away. It hurt because . . . he’s . . . angry.」
Ron:「Did you see him? Did you . . . get a vision, or something?」
Harry:「He wants something done, and it’s not happening fast enough. But . . . how do you know?」
Ron:「You could take over from Trelawney, mate. I’m not making prophecies. No, you know what you’re doing? Harry, you’re reading You-Know-Who’s mind. . . .」
Harry:「No, it’s more like . . . his mood, I suppose. I’m just getting flashes of what mood he’s in. . . . Dumbledore said something like this was happening last year. . . . He said that when Voldemort was near me, or when he was feeling hatred, I could tell. Well, now I’m feeling it when he’s pleased too . . .」
Harry:「C’mon . . . we’ve still got Silencing Charms to practice . . .」
