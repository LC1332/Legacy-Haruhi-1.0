Uncle Vernon:「“But what ARE dementoids?” asked Uncle Vernon furiously. “What do they DO?”」
Harry:「“I told you — they suck all the happiness out of you,” said Harry, “and if they get the chance, they kiss you —”」
Uncle Vernon:「“Kiss you?” said Uncle Vernon, his eyes popping slightly. “Kiss you?”」
Harry:「“It’s what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth.”」
Harry:「Of course they didn’t get his soul, you’d know if they had,」
Uncle Vernon:「Why’s he all right, then? Why isn’t he all empty, then?」
Harry:「Because I used the Patronus —」
Harry:「I can’t stop the owls coming,」
Uncle Vernon:「But what were dementoids doing in Little Whinging? Couldn’t tell you, No idea,」
Uncle Vernon:「It’s you, It’s got something to do with you, boy, I know it. Why else would they turn up here? Why else would they be down that alleyway? You’ve got to be the only — the only — The only you-know-what for miles,」
Harry:「I don’t know why they were here,」
