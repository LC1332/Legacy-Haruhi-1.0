Hermione:「Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?」
Remus John Lupin:「A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing now. There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.」
Harry:「The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom. They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close — and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.」
