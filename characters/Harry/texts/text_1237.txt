Ron:「‘Merlin’s pants’? She must be upset.」
Harry:「The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won’t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these Carrows?」
Harry:「Death Eaters. There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it’s all friends together. And I can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it’ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Azkaban — and that’s if they’re lucky. I reckon they’ll stay to try and protect the students.」
