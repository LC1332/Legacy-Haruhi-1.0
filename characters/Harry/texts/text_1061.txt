Harry:「“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snape’s row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as possible.」
Lavender:「“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender demanded suddenly.」
Harry:「“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Harry uncomfortably.」
Narrator:Harry think "On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch. Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him."
Ron:「“Oh,” said Ron, looking sheepish. “Yeah. All right.”」
Harry:「“If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,” said Harry.」
