Ron:「gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, I knew you were going to say that. But then what will you do?」
Harry:「I’m going back to the Dursleys’ once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to, said Harry. But it’ll be a short visit, and then I’ll be gone for good.」
Hermione:「But where will you go if you don’t come back to school?」
Harry:「I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow. For me, it started there, all of it. I’ve just got a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d like that.」
Ron:「At your aunt and uncle’s house. And then we’ll go with you wherever you’re going.」
Harry:「No —」
Harry:「Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?」
