Ron:「Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?」
Harry:「Probably, they don’t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there’s no other choice . . . I’ll run.」
Harry:「He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.」
Harry:「They’re not birds! They’re keys! Winged keys — look carefully. So that must mean . . . yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the door!」
Harry:「They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.」
Ron:「We’ve got to close in on it!」
Harry:「Ron, you come at it from above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down — and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!」
Harry:「Ready?」
