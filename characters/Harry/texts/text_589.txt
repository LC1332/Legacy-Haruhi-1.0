Mrs. Figg:「I hope Dumbledore murders him! Now come on, Harry, what are you waiting for?」
Harry:「I’ll take you to the door, Just in case there are more of them around. . . . Oh my word, what a catastrophe . . . and you had to fight them off yourself . . . and Dumbledore said we were to keep you from doing magic at all costs. . . . Well, it’s no good crying over spilled potion, I suppose . . . but the cat’s among the pixies now . . .」
Harry:「Dumbledore’s . . . been having . . . me followed?」
Mrs. Figg:「I’m going straight home, I’ll need to wait for more instructions. Just stay in the house. Good night.」
Harry:「Hang on, don’t go yet! I want to know —」
Harry:「He was expelled from Hogwarts. It was all over. He was never going back.」
Uncle Vernon:「“You’re going to stay here and explain how my son —”」
Harry:「“If you don’t get out of the way I’m going to jinx you,” said Harry, raising the wand.」
