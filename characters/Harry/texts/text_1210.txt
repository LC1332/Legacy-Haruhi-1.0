Ron:「“A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding. I’ll get the lights.”」
Harry:「When I get married, I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum until it’s all over.」
Fred:「She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering. Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh blimey, brace yourselves — here they come, look.」
George:「Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins. They’ll need help understanding our English customs, I’ll look after them. . . .」
Fred:「Here — permettez-moi to assister vous.」
Tonks:「Wotcher. Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night. The Ministry’s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.」
Harry:「It’s fine, I understand.」
