Ron:「You know, I’ve been wondering about that, They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer, and I couldn’t understand where they got the Galleons . . .」
Harry:「D’you reckon it’s true this year’s going to be really tough? Because of the exams?」
Ron:「Oh yeah, Bound to be, isn’t it? O.W.L.s are really important, affect the jobs you can apply for and everything. We get career advice too, later this year, Bill told me. So you can choose what N.E.W.T.s you want to do next year.」
Harry:「D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts?」
Harry:「Yeah, it would,」
Harry:「An Auror’s worthwhile!」
