Dumbledore:「There is not a shred of proof to support Black’s story, except your word — and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters’ Secret-Keeper.」
Harry:「Professor Lupin can tell you —」
Dumbledore:「Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends —」
Harry:「But —」
Dumbledore:「Sirius has not acted like an innocent man. The attack on the Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife — without Pettigrew, alive or dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius’s sentence.」
Dumbledore:「But you believe us.」
Dumbledore:「Yes, I do, But I have no power to make other men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of Magic. . . .」
Harry:「What we need, is more time.」
