Hagrid:「I’m starving. And I’ve got that detention with Snape tonight, I haven’t got much time for dinner. . . .」
:Harry spotting Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall
:Hermione caught Hermione’s arm and held her back
Harry:「If you ask me, McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting.」
Hermione:「Oh, all right then, I did it. But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Anyway, he’s got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he didn’t get in — you wouldn’t have wanted someone like that on the team.」
Harry:「No, No, I suppose that’s true. But wasn’t that dishonest, Hermione? I mean, you’re a prefect, aren’t you?」
