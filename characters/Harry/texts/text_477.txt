Dobby:「Dobby is sorry, sir! Dobby is only wanting to wish Harry Potter ‘Merry Christmas’ and bring him a present, sir! Harry Potter did say Dobby could come and see him sometimes, sir!」
Harry:「It’s okay, just prod me or something in future, all right, don’t bend over me like that. . . .」
Seamus:「Someone attacking you, Harry?」
Harry:「No, it’s just Dobby. Go back to sleep.」
Harry:「’Course you can, Er . . . I’ve got something for you too. It was a lie; he hadn’t bought anything for Dobby at all, but he quickly opened his trunk and pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled-up pair of socks. They were his oldest and foulest, mustard yellow, and had once belonged to Uncle Vernon. The reason they were extra-knobbly was that Harry had been using them to cushion his Sneakoscope for over a year now. He pulled out the Sneakoscope and handed the socks to Dobby, saying, Sorry, I forgot to wrap them. . . .」
