Mr. Diggory:「looked as though he didn’t think much of this suggestion at all」
Harry:「It was clear to Harry that Mr. Crouch was such an important member of the Ministry that he did not dare refuse him.」
Mr. Crouch:「You may rest assured that she will be punished.」
Winky:「M-m-master . . . M-m-master, p-p-please . . .」
Mr. Crouch:「Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible. I told her to remain in the tent. I told her to stay there while I went to sort out the trouble. And I find that she disobeyed me. This means clothes.」
Winky:「No, master! Not clothes, not clothes!」
Harry:「the only way to turn a house-elf free was to present it with proper garments. It was pitiful to see the way Winky clutched at her tea towel as she sobbed over Mr. Crouch’s feet.」
