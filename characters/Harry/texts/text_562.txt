Moody:「And the Death Eaters? They returned?」
Harry:「Yes, Loads of them . . .」
Moody:「How did he treat them? Did he forgive them?」
Harry:「There’s a Death Eater at Hogwarts! There’s a Death Eater here — they put my name in the Goblet of Fire, they made sure I got through to the end —」
Harry:「Karkaroff’s gone? He ran away? But then — he didn’t put my name in the goblet?」
Moody:「I assure you I did,」
Moody:「He forgave them, then? The Death Eaters who went free? The ones who escaped Azkaban?」
Harry:「What?」
