Dumbledore:「I think you know. Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.」
Harry:「He took my blood.」
Dumbledore:「Precisely! He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!」
Harry:「I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?」
Harry:「Then explain . . . more.」
Dumbledore:「He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s one last hope for himself.」
Harry:「And you knew this? You knew — all along?」
Dumbledore:「As to that, I cannot be sure.」
Harry:「Have a guess, then.」
