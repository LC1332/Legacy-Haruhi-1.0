Ron:「It was on my birthday! I was looking forward to that!」
Harry:「Not a big surprise, though, is it? Not after what happened to Katie.」
Ron:「But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition! Big birthday treat . . .」
Harry:「Happy birthday, Ron. Have a present.」
Harry:「Nice one, Harry!」
Ron:「Want one?」
Harry:「No thanks.」
Ron:「I’m not hungry.」
Harry:「I thought you just said — ?」
Ron:「It’s not that, You . . . you wouldn’t understand.」
Harry:「“Harry!” said Ron suddenly. “What?” “Harry, I can’t stand it!” “You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starting to feel definitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was about to be sick.」
Ron:「I don’t think she knows I exist, She definitely knows you exist, She keeps snogging you, doesn’t she?」
Harry:「Who are you talking about? Who are you talking about?」
Ron:「You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!」
Harry:「What was that for?」
