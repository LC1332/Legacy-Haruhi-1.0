Harry:「Yeah, but we think this time they have. Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you, and his father was on the platform, Sirius — you know, Lucius Malfoy — so don’t come up here, whatever you do, if Malfoy recognizes you again —」
Sirius:「All right, all right, I’ve got the point. Just an idea, thought you might like to get together —」
Harry:「I would, I just don’t want you chucked back in Azkaban!」
