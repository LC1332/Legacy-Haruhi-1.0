Lavender:「We are! We went up to her office to see her, we took her some daffodils — not the honking ones that Sprout’s got, nice ones . . .」
Harry:「How is she?」
Lavender:「Not very good, poor thing. She was crying and saying she’d rather leave the castle forever than stay here if Umbridge is still here, and I don’t blame her. Umbridge was horrible to her, wasn’t she?」
Hermione:「I’ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible.」
Ron:「Impossible. She can’t get any worse than she’s been already.」
Hermione:「You mark my words, she’s going to want revenge on Dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her. Especially another part-human. You saw the look on her face when she saw Firenze . . .」
Ron:「Aren’t we going up to North Tower? How d’you expect Firenze to climb that ladder? We’re in classroom eleven now, it was on the notice board yesterday.」
Harry:「What the — ?」
