Narrator:Professor Trelawney think "you have the Grim"
Harry:「The what?」
:Everyone action
Narrator:Professor Trelawney think "The Grim, my dear, the Grim! The giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! My dear boy, it is an omen — the worst omen — of death!"
Hermione:「I don’t think it looks like a Grim」
Narrator:Professor Trelawney think "You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very little aura around you. Very little receptivity to the resonances of the future."
Seamus Finnigan:「It looks like a Grim if you do this, but it looks more like a donkey from here」
Harry:「When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going to die or not!」
