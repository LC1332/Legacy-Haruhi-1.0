Hermione:「But it’ll be fascinating to study them from the Wizarding point of view.」
Harry:「Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?」
Hermione:「I’ve still got ten Galleons, It’s my birthday in September, and Mum and Dad gave me some money to get myself an early birthday present.」
Ron:「How about a nice book?」
Hermione:「No, I don’t think so, I really want an owl. I mean, Harry’s got Hedwig and you’ve got Errol —」
Ron:「I haven’t, Errol’s a family owl. All I’ve got is Scabbers. And I want to get him checked over. I don’t think Egypt agreed with him.」
:Scabbers looking thinner than usual, definite droop to his whiskers
Harry:「There’s a magical creature shop just over there, You could see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her owl.」
