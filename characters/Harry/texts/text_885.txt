Umbridge:「What Cornelius doesn’t know won’t hurt him. He never knew I ordered dementors after Potter last summer, but he was delighted to be given the chance to expel him, all the same. . . .」
Harry:「You sent the dementors after me?」
Umbridge:「Somebody had to act. They were all bleating about silencing you somehow — discrediting you — but I was the one who actually did something about it . . . Only you wriggled out of that one, didn’t you, Potter? Not today, though, not now . . .」
Hermione:「No — Harry — Harry, we’ll have to tell her!」
Harry:「No way!」
