Malfoy:「Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?」
Harry:「Yeah, that’s right.」
Malfoy:「Of course, if it was me, I’d have done something before now. I wouldn’t be staying in school like a good boy, I’d be out there looking for him.」
Ron:「Don’t you know, Potter?」
Malfoy:「Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck. Want to leave it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d hunt him down myself.」
Harry:「What are you talking about, Malfoy?」
:Hermione action
Harry:「What did Malfoy mean? Why would I want revenge on Black? He hasn’t done anything to me — yet.」
