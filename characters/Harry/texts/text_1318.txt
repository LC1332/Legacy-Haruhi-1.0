Griphook:「The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had shown Harry.」
he:「What do you seek within the Lestranges’ vault? The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real one. I think that you already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.」
Harry:「But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it? Perhaps you’ve seen the other things in there?」
Harry:「Will you help us? We haven’t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin’s help. You’re our one chance.」
Griphook:「I think that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .」
Harry:「Yeah, of course, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resentment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him.」
