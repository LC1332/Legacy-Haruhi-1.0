Hagrid:「Not in trouble, are yeh? Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my fault —」
Harry:「No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too. He’s gone to change into something more suitable, I think . . . and he said he’d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog’s memory. . . .」
Hagrid:「Did he? Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in either. I’ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before. . . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve liked that, Aragog would. . . .」
Harry:「Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?」
