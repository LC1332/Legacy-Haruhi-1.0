Uncle Vernon:「We’re going out. Sorry? We — that is to say, your aunt, Dudley, and I — are going out. Fine. You are not to leave your bedroom while we are away. Okay. You are not to touch the television, the stereo, or any of our possessions. Right. You are not to steal food from the fridge. Okay. I am going to lock your door. You do that.」
Harry:「The Dursleys couldn’t be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn’t heard their car. There was silence for a few seconds, and then he heard voices. Burglars, he thought, sliding off the bed onto his feet — but a split second later it occurred to him that burglars would keep their voices down, and whoever was moving around in the kitchen was certainly not troubling to do so. He snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door, listening with all his might. Next moment he jumped as the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open. Harry stood motionless, staring through the open door at the dark upstairs landing, straining his ears for further sounds, but none came. He hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stairs. His heart shot upward into his throat. There were people standing in the shadowy hall below, silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door; eight or nine of them, all, as far as he could see, looking up at him. “Lower your wand, boy, before you take someone’s eye out,” said a low, growling voice. Harry’s heart was thumping uncontrollably. He knew that voice, but he did not lower his wand. “Professor Moody?” he said uncertainly. “I don’t know so much about ‘Professor,’” growled the voice, “never got round to much teaching, did I? Get down here, we want to see you properly.”」
