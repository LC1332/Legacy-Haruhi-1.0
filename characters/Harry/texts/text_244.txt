Filch:「Well, get back to your common room where you belong!」
Harry:「passed out of sight.」
Harry:「climbed a staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, and was walking along another corridor when a voice from inside one of the rooms said, “Harry?”」
Harry:「Hogsmeade.」
Lupin:「Water demon. We shouldn’t have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally long fingers? Strong, but very brittle.」
Lupin:「Cup of tea? I was just thinking of making one.」
Harry:「All right.」
Harry:「How did you know about that?」
Narrator:Harry think "He thought for a moment of telling Lupin about the dog he’d seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn’t want Lupin to think he was a coward, especially since Lupin already seemed to think he couldn’t cope with a boggart."
Harry:「Yes, You know that day we fought the boggart?」
