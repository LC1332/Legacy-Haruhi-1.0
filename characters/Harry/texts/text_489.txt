Bagman:「Well, I just thought I’d congratulate you again on your splendid performance against that Horntail, Harry, said Bagman. Really superb.」
Harry:「Thanks, said Harry, but he knew this couldn’t be all that Bagman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione. Bagman didn’t seem in any particular rush to spill the beans, though. Harry saw him glance into the mirror over the bar at the goblins, who were all watching him and Harry in silence through their dark, slanting eyes.」
Bagman:「Absolute nightmare, said Bagman to Harry in an undertone, noticing Harry watching the goblins too. Their English isn’t too good . . . it’s like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup . . . but at least they used sign language another human could recognize. This lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook . . . and I only know one word of Gobbledegook. Bladvak. It means ‘pickax.’ I don’t like to use it in case they think I’m threatening them. He gave a short, booming laugh.」
Harry:「What do they want? Harry said, noticing how the goblins were still watching Bagman very closely.」
