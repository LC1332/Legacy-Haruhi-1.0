Xenophilius:「May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make it ourselves. Luna is down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plimpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help yourselves to sugar.」

Harry:「Well, it’s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur’s wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it meant.」

Harry:「“Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak?”」
