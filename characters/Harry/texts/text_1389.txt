Narrator:Dumbledore think "Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power."
Harry:「But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrimgeour!」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "Would I? asked Dumbledore heavily. I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well."
Narrator:Dumbledore think "I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher —"
Harry:「You were the best —」
Harry:「What’ve you done to him?」
