Hermione:「They obviously can’t talk freely in the staffroom anymore. Not with Umbridge there.」
Harry:「Reckon they know anything new?」
Ron:「If they do, we’re not going to hear about it, are we? Not after Decree . . . What number are we on now?」
Harry:「This latest decree had been the subject of a great number of jokes among the students. Lee Jordan had pointed out to Umbridge that by the terms of the new rule she was not allowed to tell Fred and George off for playing Exploding Snap in the back of the class. Exploding Snap’s got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor! That’s not information relating to your subject!」
