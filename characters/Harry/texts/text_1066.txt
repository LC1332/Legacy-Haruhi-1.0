Kreacher:「Master called me? — Yeah, I did — Kreacher will do whatever Master wants — because Kreacher has no choice, but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master, yes — Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys? Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood great-nephew of my old mistress?」
Harry:「That’s the one, And you’re forbidden to tip him off, Kreacher, or to show him what you’re up to, or to talk to him at all, or to write him messages or . . . or to contact him in any way. Got it?」
Kreacher:「Master thinks of everything, and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy, oh yes. . . .」
Harry:「That’s settled, then, I’ll want regular reports, but make sure I’m not surrounded by people when you turn up. Ron and Hermione are okay. And don’t tell anyone what you’re doing. Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters.」
Harry:「What did they row about?」
Harry:「Yeah, well, there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it. Or are they still together?」
