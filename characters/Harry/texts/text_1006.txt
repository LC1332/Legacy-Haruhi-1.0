Dumbledore:「Professor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungo’s staff are sending me hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recovery in time.」
Harry:「Where were you this weekend, sir?」
Dumbledore:「I would rather not say just now. However, I shall tell you in due course.」
Harry:「You will?」
Dumbledore:「Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with light-fingered contempt. He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me. However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Sirius’s old possessions.」
Phineas Nigellus:「That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?」
Harry:「did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About Draco Malfoy?」
Harry:「If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second?」
