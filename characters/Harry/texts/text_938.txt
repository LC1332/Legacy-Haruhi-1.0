Mrs. Weasley:「I’ve got Fred and George’s room all ready for you, you’ll have it to yourself.」
Harry:「Why, where are they?」
Mrs. Weasley:「Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop as they’re so busy. I must say, I didn’t approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business! Come on, dear, your trunk’s already up there.」
Harry:「’Night, Mr. Weasley.」
