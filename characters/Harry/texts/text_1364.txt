Professor McGonagall:「Potter, Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?」
Harry:「What? Oh, oh yeah!」
Professor McGonagall:「Then go, Potter, go!」
Harry:「Right, yeah」
Narrator:Harry think "But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem . . . and how could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?"
Harry:「Harry! My dear boy!」
Harry:「It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?」
Gray Lady:「You’re the Gray Lady?」
Harry:「The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?」
Gray Lady:「I am afraid that I cannot help you.」
Harry:「WAIT! This is urgent. If that diadem’s at Hogwarts, I’ve got to find it, fast.」
Gray Lady:「Of course I — how dare you suggest — ?」
Harry:「Well, help me, then!」
