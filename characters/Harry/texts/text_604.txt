Ron:「We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on. We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen him twice since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted —」
Harry:「He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to」
Hermione:「I thought that too. But he didn’t want you to know anything.」
Harry:「Maybe he thinks I can’t be trusted」
Harry:「So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys’ while you two get to join in everything that’s going on here? How come you two are allowed to know everything that’s going on — ?」
Harry:「WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR? WHO SAW HIM COME BACK? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM? ME!」
Hermione:「Well, he did —」
Harry:「FOUR WEEKS I’VE BEEN STUCK IN PRIVET DRIVE, NICKING PAPERS OUT OF BINS TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHAT’S BEEN GOING ON —」
