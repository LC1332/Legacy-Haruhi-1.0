Hermione:「They shouldn’t have written on the sign!」
Harry:「It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I . . .」
Harry:「Are you Bathilda?」
Hermione:「Let’s go.」
Harry:「I’m not sure about this.」
Bathilda:「Come!」
Hermione:「It’s okay.」
Harry:「Let me do that.」
Harry:「Who is this person?」
Hermione:「Was there something you wanted to tell us?」
Bathilda:「You want us to leave?」
Harry:「I think she wants me to go upstairs with her.」
Hermione:「Why?」
Hermione:「Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?」
Hermione:「Do you really think she knows who you are?」
Harry:「Yes, I think she does.」
Harry:「Have you got anything for me?」
:Bathilda closed her eyes, Harry's scar prickled painfully, the Horcrux twitched, the room dissolved momentarily
Harry:「Have you got anything for me?」
