Dumbledore:「They brought the kids from the orphanage here?」
Harry:「Not here, precisely. There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes. And he brought two small children with him, probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have done it, don’t you?」
Harry:「But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on. Come.」
Harry:「You will not object to getting a little wet?」
Harry:「Yes, this is the place.」
Dumbledore:「This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall. We need to penetrate the inner place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our way, rather than those nature made. . . .」
Dumbledore:「Here. We go on through here. The entrance is concealed.」
Harry:「Thank you.」
