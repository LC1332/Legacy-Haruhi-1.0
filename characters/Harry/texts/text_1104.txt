Riddle:「Well, you split your soul, you see, and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form . . .」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "A bit . . . or more, You heard Voldemort: What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux, what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul repeatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes. No book would have given him that information. As far as I know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two. Four years ago, I received what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul."
Harry:「Where? How?」
Dumbledore:「You handed it to me, Harry, The diary, Riddle’s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets.」
Harry:「I don’t understand, sir.」
