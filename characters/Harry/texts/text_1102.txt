:Slughorn passed it across the table to Harry
Harry:「Thank you very much, Professor.」
Slughorn:「You’re a good boy, And you’ve got her eyes. . . . Just don’t think too badly of me once you’ve seen it. . . .」
:Slughorn put his head on his arms, gave a deep sigh, and fell asleep
Harry:「I’m really sorry — I had to go out for something important —」
Fat Lady:「That’s the way it is. If you’re angry, go and take it up with the headmaster, he’s the one who’s tightened security.」
Harry:「Fantastic. Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here, because he’s the one who wanted me to —」
Nick:「Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it’s a favorite pastime of his —」
Harry:「Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!」
Dumbledore:「Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew you could do it!」
Dumbledore:「And now, at last, we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .」
Harry:「Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.」
