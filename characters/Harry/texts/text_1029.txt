Slughorn:「Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, Harry?」
Harry:「Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration, Herbology . . .」
Snape:「All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror.」
Harry:「Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do.」
Harry:「inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh.」
Argus Filch:「You’re in trouble, you are! Didn’t the headmaster say that nighttime prowling’s out, unless you’ve got permission, didn’t he, eh?」
Slughorn:「That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right. It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a party. Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay, Draco.」
Harry:「Filch’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and . . . was it possible? . . . a little afraid?」
