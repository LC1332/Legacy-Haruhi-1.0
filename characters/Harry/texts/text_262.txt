Hermione:「Are you going to report me?」
Harry:「Seen the Fizzing Whizbees, Harry? And the Jelly Slugs? And the Acid Pops? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it burnt a hole right through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick. Reckon Fred’d take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts?」
:Ron grabbing Harry and leading him over to their barrel
:Ron staring broodingly into the Acid Pop box
Ron:「shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?」
:Harry shivering
Harry:「Merry Christmas!」
