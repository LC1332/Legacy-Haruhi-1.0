Snape:「Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells, Potter?」
Harry:「Yes, sir. There’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ Professor.」
Snape:「Detention, Saturday night, my office. I do not take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even ‘the Chosen One.’」
Ron:「That was brilliant, Harry!」
Hermione:「You really shouldn’t have said it. What made you?」
Harry:「He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice! I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn’t he use another guinea pig for a change? What’s Dumbledore playing at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructible stuff —」
Hermione:「Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face Voldemort. You said it wasn’t just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was just you and your brains and your guts — well, wasn’t that what Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and quick-thinking?」
Harry:「Harry! Hey, Harry!」
