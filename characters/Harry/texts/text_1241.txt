Hermione:「Harry, you aren’t supposed to let this happen anymore! Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! He thought the connection was dangerous — Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how can it help?」
Harry:「Because it means I know what he’s doing.」
Hermione:「So you’re not even going to try to shut him out?」
Harry:「Hermione, I can’t. You know I’m lousy at Occlumency, I never got the hang of it.」
Hermione:「I — no — I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean —」
Harry:「I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he’s most dangerous. But I’m going to use it.」
Hermione:「Who?」
Harry:「He’s a foreign wandmaker. He made Krum’s wand and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.」
Hermione:「Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did, but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?」
Harry:「Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!」
