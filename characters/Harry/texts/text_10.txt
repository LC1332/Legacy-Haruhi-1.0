Hagrid:「Seems a shame ter row, though, If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?」
Harry:「Of course not,」
Hagrid:「Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts? Spells — enchantments, They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.」
Harry:「There’s a Ministry of Magic?」
Hagrid:「Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.」
Hagrid:「Hagrid, did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?」
Hagrid:「Well, so they say, Crikey, I’d like a dragon.」
Hagrid:「Still got yer letter, Harry?」
Harry:「Good, There’s a list there of everything yeh need.」
