Fred:「Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.」
Harry:「You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.」
George:「Well, that’s that plan scuppered. Obviously there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.」
Fred:「Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use magic; we’ve got no chance.」
Harry:「Funny, really amusing.」
