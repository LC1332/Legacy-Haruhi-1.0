Fat Lady:「Well, well, well, Violet’s just told me everything. Who’s just been chosen as school champion, then?」
Harry:「Balderdash.」
Fat Lady:「It most certainly isn’t!」
Fat Lady:「No, no, Vi, it’s the password.」
Harry:「I’m not hungry, I had enough at the feast —」
Harry:「I’m tired! No, seriously, George — I’m going to bed —」
Harry:「What d’you mean, congratulations?」
Ron:「What would they do that for?」
Harry:「I dunno.」
Ron:「Yeah, okay. Only you said this morning you’d have done it last night, and no one would’ve seen you. . . . I’m not stupid, you know.」
Harry:「You’re doing a really good impression of it.」
Harry:「Hello, I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?」
Harry:「Have you seen Ron?」
Hermione:「Well . . . no, I don’t think so . . . not really.」
Harry:「What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?」
