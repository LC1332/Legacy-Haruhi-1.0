Sirius:「It doesn’t matter, don’t apologize. I don’t like being back here. I never thought I’d be stuck in this house again.」
Harry:「It’s ideal for headquarters, of course. My father put every security measure known to Wizard-kind on it when he lived here. It’s Unplottable, so Muggles could never come and call — as if they’d have wanted to — and now Dumbledore’s added his protection, you’d be hard put to find a safer house anywhere. Dumbledore’s Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore . . . If my parents could see the use it was being put to now . . . well, my mother’s portrait should give you some idea . . .」
Sirius:「I wouldn’t mind if I could just get out occasionally and do something useful. I’ve asked Dumbledore whether I can escort you to your hearing — as Snuffles, obviously — so I can give you a bit of moral support, what d’you think?」
Harry:「Don’t worry, I’m sure they’re going to clear you, there’s definitely something in the International Statute of Secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life.」
