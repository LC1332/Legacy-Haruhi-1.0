Hermione:「You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —」
Harry:「What is it?」
Percy:「N-nothing.」
Harry:「Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?」
Dumbledore:「First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.」
Dumbledore:「I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.」
Dumbledore:「Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.」
Dumbledore:「And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.」
Harry:「He’s not serious?」
