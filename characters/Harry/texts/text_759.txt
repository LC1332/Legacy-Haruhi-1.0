Harry:「it was already ten past nine, which meant they needed to get back to their common rooms immediately or risk being caught and punished by Filch for being out-of-bounds.」

Angelina:「The Quidditch season’s about to start, we need team practices too!」
Harry:「Let’s say next Wednesday night, then, and we can decide on additional meetings then. . . . Come on, we’d better get going . . .」
