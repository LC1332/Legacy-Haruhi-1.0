Dumbledore:「Oh yes. We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.」
Harry:「And where would it take me?」
Dumbledore:「On.」
Harry:「Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.」
Dumbledore:「I think that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning here than he does.」
Harry:「Tell me one last thing. Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?」
Bellatrix:「My Lord . . . my Lord . . .」
Voldemort:「That will do.」
Voldemort:「The boy . . . Is he dead?」
Voldemort:「You. Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.」
Harry:「Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?」
