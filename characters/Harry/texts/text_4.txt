Uncle Vernon:「Make Harry get it.」
Harry:「Get the mail, Harry.」
Uncle Vernon:「Make Dudley get it.」
Dudley:「Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.」
Harry:「Where’s my letter? Who’s writing to me?」
Uncle Vernon:「SILENCE!」
Harry:「Why?」
Harry:「Why?」
Uncle Vernon:「Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom. Dudley — go — just go.」
Harry:「Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.」
Harry:「He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.」
