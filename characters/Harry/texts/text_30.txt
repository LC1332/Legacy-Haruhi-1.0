Neville:「Idiot boy!」
Harry:「why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.」
Ron:「Don’t push it, I’ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.」
Harry:「Cheer up, Snape’s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?」
Hagrid:「Another Weasley, eh? I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.」
Harry:「The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons.」
Hagrid:「How’s yer brother Charlie? I liked him a lot — great with animals.」
Harry:「Hagrid! that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!」
