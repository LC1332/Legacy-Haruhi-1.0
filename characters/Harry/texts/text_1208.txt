Hermione:「I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!」
Harry:「D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he’d left us?」
Hermione:「Definitely, He couldn’t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . .」
Ron:「why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?」
Hermione:「Well, exactly, If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?」
Ron:「Thought wrong, then, didn’t he? I always said he was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch — what the hell was that about?」
Hermione:「I’ve no idea, When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!」
Harry:「Yeah, well, I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?」
