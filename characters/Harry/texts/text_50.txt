Hagrid:「The library? Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?」
Harry:「Oh, we’re not working, Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.」
Hermione:「We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all, Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?」
Harry:「We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and we can’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve read his name somewhere.」
Harry:「What are you looking for, boy?」
