Harry:「Master, I crave your pardon . . .」
Harry:「Stand up, Rookwood.」

Rookwood:「Of course, my Lord, of course . . . anything . . .」
Harry:「Very well . . . you may go. Send Avery to me.」
Ron:「Will you stop acting like a maniac, and I can get you out of here!」
Ron:「Has someone been attacked again? Is it Dad? Is it that snake?」
Harry:「No — everyone’s fine — Well . . . Avery isn’t. . . . He’s in trouble. . . . He gave him the wrong information. . . . He’s really angry . . .」
