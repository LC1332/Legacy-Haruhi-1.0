Dumbledore:「Voldemort’s mistake, Harry, Voldemort’s mistake . . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful not to touch the water.」
Harry:「Professor! I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!」
Dumbledore:「Yes, I am sure you did.」
Harry:「So that thing that jumped out of the water — ? There are bodies in here!」
Dumbledore:「Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us. There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry, any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness. Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.」
Harry:「But one of them jumped. When I tried to Summon the Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.」
Dumbledore:「Careful not to touch the water.」
Harry:「What is it?」
Dumbledore:「I cannot touch. See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.」
Harry:「Out of the way, please, Harry.」
Harry:「“No!”」
