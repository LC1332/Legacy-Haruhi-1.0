Lupin:「Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard. That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it’s also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status — meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent — before they are allowed to attend.」
Harry:「It’s . . . it’s . . .」
Lupin:「I know.」
Lupin:「I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.」
Harry:「He did, and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they’re coming with me.」
