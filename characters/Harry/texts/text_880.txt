Hermione:「But Harry — what if your dream was — was just that, a dream?」
Harry:「You don’t get it! I’m not having nightmares, I’m not just dreaming! What d’you think all the Occlumency was for, why d’you think Dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these things? Because they’re REAL, Hermione — Sirius is trapped — I’ve seen him — Voldemort’s got him, and no one else knows, and that means we’re the only ones who can save him, and if you don’t want to do it, fine, but I’m going, understand? And if I remember rightly, you didn’t have a problem with my saving-people-thing when it was you I was saving from the dementors, or — when it was your sister I was saving from the basilisk —」
Ron:「I never said I had a problem!」
Hermione:「But Harry, you’ve just said it, Dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these things out of your mind, if you’d done Occlumency properly you’d never have seen this —」
Harry:「IF YOU THINK I’M JUST GOING TO ACT LIKE I HAVEN’T SEEN —」
Ginny:「We recognized Harry’s voice — what are you yelling about?」
Harry:「Never you mind.」
