Hermione:「It’s only a game, isn’t it?」
Harry:「Hermione, you’re good on feelings and stuff, but you just don’t understand about Quidditch.」
Hermione:「Maybe not, but at least my happiness doesn’t depend on Ron’s goalkeeping ability.」
Harry:「Good catch.」
Ginny:「Angelina still won’t let him resign, She says she knows he’s got it in him.」
Fred:「I haven’t got the heart to take the mickey out of him, even, Mind you . . . when he missed the fourteenth . . . Well, I’ll save it for parties, eh?」
Harry:「It had been immensely frustrating watching from the sidelines. He was quite impressed by Ginny’s performance but he felt that if he had been playing he could have caught the Snitch sooner. . . . There had been a moment when it had been fluttering near Kirke’s ankle; if she hadn’t hesitated, she might have been able to scrape a win for Gryffindor. . . .」
