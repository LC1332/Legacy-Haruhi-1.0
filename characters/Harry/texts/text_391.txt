Nearly Headless Nick:「Good evening.」
Harry:「Says who? Hope they hurry up with the Sorting. I’m starving.」
:Professor McGonagall action
Narrator:The Sorting Hat think "A thousand years or more ago, When I was newly sewn, There lived four wizards of renown, Whose names are still well known: Bold Gryffindor, from wild moor, Fair Ravenclaw, from glen, Sweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad, Shrewd Slytherin, from fen. They shared a wish, a hope, a dream, They hatched a daring plan To educate young sorcerers Thus Hogwarts School began. Now each of these four founders Formed their own House, for each Did value different virtues In the ones they had to teach. By Gryffindor, the bravest were Prized far beyond the rest; For Ravenclaw, the cleverest Would always be the best; For Hufflepuff, hard workers were Most worthy of admission; And power-hungry Slytherin Loved those of great ambition. While still alive they did divide Their favorites from the throng, Yet how to pick the worthy ones When they were dead and gone? ’Twas Gryffindor who found the way, He whipped me off his head The founders put some brains in me So I could choose instead! Now slip me snug about your ears, I’ve never yet been wrong, I’ll have a look inside your mind And tell where you belong!"
Harry:「That’s not the song it sang when it Sorted us, Sings a different one every year, It’s got to be a pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat? I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.」
