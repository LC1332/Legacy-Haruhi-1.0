Hermione:「Ginny used to fancy Harry, but she gave up on him months ago. Not that she doesn’t like you, of course, she added kindly to Harry while she examined a long black-and-gold quill.」
Harry:「So that’s why she talks now? She never used to talk in front of me.」
Hermione:「Exactly, Yes, I think I’ll have this one . . .」
:Hermione went up to the counter and handed over fifteen Sickles and two Knuts
Ron:「Ron, she said severely as she turned and trod on his feet, this is exactly why Ginny hasn’t told you she’s seeing Michael, she knew you’d take it badly. So don’t harp on about it, for heaven’s sake.」
Ron:「What d’you mean, who’s taking anything badly? I’m not going to harp on about anything . . .」
:Hermione rolled her eyes at Harry and then said in an undertone, while Ron was muttering imprecations about Michael Corner, And talking about Michael and Ginny . . . what about Cho and you?
Harry:「What d’you mean?」
