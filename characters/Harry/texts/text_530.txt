Ron:「That’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He’d done a runner.」
Harry:「He seemed really weak — I don’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.」
Hermione:「You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven’t I told you enough times?」
Ron:「Krum attacked Crouch — no, wait for it — and then Stunned himself!」
Hermione:「And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?」
Harry:「He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son.」
Ron:「But he was out of his mind, like you said, so half of it was probably just raving. . . .」
Harry:「He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort. He was having real trouble stringing two words together, but that was when he seemed to know where he was, and know what he wanted to do. He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore.」
Harry:「Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something.」
