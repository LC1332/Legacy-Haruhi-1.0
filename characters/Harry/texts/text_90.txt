Dobby:「Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew. . . .」
Harry:「Whatever you’ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that’s Hermione, she —」
Dobby:「Harry Potter is humble and modest. Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named —」
Harry:「Voldemort?」
Dobby:「Dobby heard tell that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter escaped yet again.」
Harry:「W-what? But I’ve got to go back — term starts on September first. It’s all that’s keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like here. I don’t belong here. I belong in your world — at Hogwarts.」
Dobby:「There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!」
Harry:「What terrible things? Who’s plotting them?」
