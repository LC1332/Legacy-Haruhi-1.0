Dumbledore:「“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know where it fell?”」
Harry:「“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.」
Harry:「“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.」
Harry:「Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see.」

Harry:「As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand were rejoicing at their reunion.」
