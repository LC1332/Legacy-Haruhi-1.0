Professor McGonagall:「Potter, I know what I’m talking about. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.」
Harry:「It’s tonight. Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.」
Hermione:「But what can we —」
Hermione:「Good afternoon.」
Snape:「You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this. Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?」
Snape:「Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.」
Harry:「Right, here’s what we’ve got to do. One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.」
Hermione:「Oh, shut up.」
Harry:「And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor. Come on.」
