Ginny:「Bill doesn’t like him either.」
Harry:「Is Bill here? I thought he was working in Egypt.」
Fred:「He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order, He says he misses the tombs, but, there are compensations . . .」
Harry:「What d’you mean?」
George:「Charlie’s in the Order too, but he’s still in Romania, Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible, so Charlie’s trying to make contacts on his days off.」
Harry:「Couldn’t Percy do that?」
Ginny:「It’s been awful.」
George:「I think we’re well shut of him.」
Harry:「What’s happened?」
Harry:「You’re kidding?」
