Dumbledore:「Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry. It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . . Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.」
Harry:「What does it mean? Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been — Professor?」
Dumbledore:「Go and wake Severus. Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody else, and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.」
Harry:「But — You swore to obey me, Harry — go!」
Harry:「No, I’ve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.」
