Voldemort:「roared」
:Harry spell to Voldemort
Harry:「I don’t want anyone else to try to help. It’s got to be like this. It’s got to be me.」
Voldemort:「hissed」
Harry:「Nobody. There are no more Horcruxes. It’s just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good. . . .」
Voldemort:「Accidents!」
Harry:「You won’t be killing anyone else tonight. You won’t be able to kill any of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people —」
Voldemort:「did not speak」
Harry:「Is it love again? Dumbledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking like an old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter — and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?」
