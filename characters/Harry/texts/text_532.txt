Hermione:「D’you think it’s too early to go and see Professor Moody?」
Harry:「Yes, he’d probably blast us through the door if we wake him at the crack of dawn; he’ll think we’re trying to attack him while he’s asleep. Let’s give it till break」
:Professor Moody looked tired
:Professor Moody eyelid of his normal eye was drooping
Harry:「Professor Moody?」
Moody:「No.」
Harry:「Did you use the map?」
Hermione:「There are other ways he could have disappeared, aren’t there, Professor?」
Moody:「You’re another one who might think about a career as an Auror. Mind works the right way, Granger.」
Harry:「Well, he wasn’t invisible. The map shows invisible people. He must’ve left the grounds, then.」
