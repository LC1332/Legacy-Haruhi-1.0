:Lupin separated Harry’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s wands and threw each back to its owner
Harry:「There, You’re armed, we’re not. Now will you listen?」
Harry:「You know how to work it?」
Lupin:「The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed. And I was right, wasn’t I?」
:Lupin started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little patches of dust rose at his feet.
Harry:「How d’you know about the Cloak?」
Harry:「No, we weren’t!」
