Harry:「Nothing. I need to go to the hospital wing, I think. Bad headache.」
Professor Trelawney:「You were clutching your scar! You were rolling on the floor, clutching your scar! Come now, Potter, I have experience in these matters!」
Harry:「I don’t want to see anything except a headache cure.」
Harry:「Lemon drop? Pear Drop. Er — Licorice Wand. Fizzing Whizbee. Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum. Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans . . . oh no, he doesn’t like them, does he? . . . oh just open, can’t you? I really need to see him, it’s urgent!」
