Ron:「We’d have seen her in the garden! Anyway, she’s not supposed to come into school anymore, Hagrid said Dumbledore banned her. . . .」
Harry:「Maybe she’s got an Invisibility Cloak, Sort of thing she’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.」
Hermione:「Like you and Ron did, you mean.」
Ron:「We weren’t trying to hear him! We didn’t have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him!」
Harry:「We’ve got to go and see him, This evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?」
Hermione:「What’s he avoiding us for? He surely doesn’t think we’d care about him being half-giant?」
Hermione:「I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet, Really get to work on that egg.」
Harry:「Oh I — I reckon I’ve got a pretty good idea what it’s about now,」
