Ron:「Come and look at this. What’s Malfoy doing?」
Harry:「He looks like he’s using a walkie-talkie.」
Hermione:「He can’t be, I’ve told you, those sorts of things don’t work around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry, let’s try that Shield Charm again.」
Narrator:Sirius think "If Voldemort is really getting stronger again, my priority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands on you while you are under Dumbledore’s protection, but all the same, take no risks: Concentrate on getting through that maze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other matters."
Narrator:Harry think "Harry’s nerves mounted as June the twenty-fourth drew closer, but they were not as bad as those he had felt before the first and second tasks. For one thing, he was confident that, this time, he had done everything in his power to prepare for the task. For another, this was the final hurdle, and however well or badly he did, the tournament would at last be over, which would be an enormous relief."
Harry:「Rita Skeeter again?」
Harry:「Let me see it. Give it here.」
