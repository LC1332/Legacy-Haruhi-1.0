Mrs. Weasley:「Because you’re not of age and you haven’t passed your test,」
Harry:「You have to pass a test to Apparate?」
Mr. Weasley:「The Department of Magical Transportation had to fine a couple of people the other day for Apparating without a license. It’s not easy, Apparition, and when it’s not done properly it can lead to nasty complications. This pair I’m talking about went and Splinched themselves.」
Harry:「Er — Splinched?」
Mr. Weasley:「Oh yes,」
Harry:「But Bill and Charlie and Percy can all do it?」
