Narrator:Voldemort think "But what does it matter? Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy. . . ."
Harry:「But you’re too late, said Harry. You’ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand from him.」
Harry:「So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it? Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.」
