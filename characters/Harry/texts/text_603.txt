Mrs. Weasley:「I’ll explain later, I’ve got to hurry, I’m supposed to be at the meeting — I’ll just show you where you’re sleeping.」
Harry:「Mrs. Weasley, why — ?」
Mrs. Weasley:「Ron and Hermione will explain everything, dear, I’ve really got to dash.」
:Harry crossed the dingy landing, turned the bedroom doorknob, which was shaped like a serpent’s head, and opened the door.
:Hermione beaming, let go of Harry
:Hedwig soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on Harry’s shoulder
Ron:「She’s been in a right state, Pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters, look at this —」
Harry:「Sorry about that, but I wanted answers, you know . . .」
Harry:「Have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer?」
Hermione:「He was so angry. Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended. He was scary.」
Harry:「Well, I’m glad he left. If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.」
