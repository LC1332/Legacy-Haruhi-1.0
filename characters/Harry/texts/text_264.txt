Hermione:「Don’t be silly, Harry doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?」
:Harry didn’t answer. He didn’t know what he wanted to do. All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black was at liberty, was almost more than he could stand.
Harry:「Malfoy knows. Remember what he said to me in Potions? ‘If it was me, I’d hunt him down myself. . . . I’d want revenge.’」
Ron:「You’re going to take Malfoy’s advice instead of ours?」
:Harry ignoring Ron
Hermione:「Harry, please, please be sensible. Black did a terrible, terrible thing, but d-don’t put yourself in danger, it’s what Black wants. . . . Oh, Harry, you’d be playing right into Black’s hands if you went looking for him. Your mum and dad wouldn’t want you to get hurt, would they? They’d never want you to go looking for Black!」
Harry:「I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because thanks to Black, I’ve never spoken to them,」
