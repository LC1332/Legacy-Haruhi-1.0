Ron:「She doesn’t know, She’s just trying to get us to talk to her again.」
Harry:「What’s that?」
Lupin:「Another boggart, I’ve been combing the castle ever since Tuesday, and very luckily, I found this one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my office when we’re not using him; there’s a cupboard under my desk he’ll like.」
Harry:「Okay」
Lupin:「Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus, which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.」
Harry:「What does a Patronus look like?」
Lupin:「With an incantation, which will work only if you are concentrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.」
Harry:「Right」
