Dumbledore:「I must go downstairs. I must see the Diggorys. Harry — take the rest of your potion. I will see all of you later.」
Harry:「You’ve got to take the rest of your potion, Harry. You have a good long sleep. Try and think about something else for a while . . . think about what you’re going to buy with your winnings!」
Harry:「I don’t want that gold. You have it. Anyone can have it. I shouldn’t have won it. It should’ve been Cedric’s.」
Harry:「I told him to take the Cup with me.」
