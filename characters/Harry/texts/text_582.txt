Uncle Vernon:「Yes — yes, good point, Petunia! What were you doing under our window, boy?」
Harry:「Listening to the news,」
Aunt Petunia:「Don’t you be clever with me, boy! I want to know what you’re really up to — and don’t give me any more of this listening to the news tosh! You know perfectly well that your lot . . .」
Uncle Vernon:「That’s all you know,」
Aunt Petunia:「You’re a nasty little liar. What are all those — owls — doing if they’re not bringing you news?」
Uncle Vernon:「Get out of that one, boy! As if we didn’t know you get all your news from those pestilential birds!」
Harry:「The owls . . . aren’t bringing me news,」
Aunt Petunia:「We know you’re up to something funny,」
Uncle Vernon:「We’re not stupid, you know,」
Harry:「Well, that’s news to me,」
