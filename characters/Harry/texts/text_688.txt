Hermione:「Oh, Harry, it’s you. . . . Good about Ron, isn’t it? she said blearily. I’m just so — so — so tired, she yawned. I was up until one o’clock making more hats. They’re disappearing like mad!」
Harry:「Great, said Harry distractedly; if he did not tell somebody soon, he would burst. Listen, Hermione, I was just up in Umbridge’s office and she touched my arm . . .」
:Hermione listened closely
Harry:「You’re worried that You-Know-Who’s controlling her like he controlled Quirrell?」
:Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment
Hermione:「She’s horrible, yes, but . . . Harry, I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt.」
Harry:「I’m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it’s not a big deal. It’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse tonight, that’s all —」
Hermione:「Don’t say that, it’s not true!」
Harry:「I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks —」
