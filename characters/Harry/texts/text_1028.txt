Hermione:「There’s a difference, I’ve got no plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have happened at Keeper tryouts.」

Hermione:「Quidditch! Is that all boys care about? Cormac hasn’t asked me one single question about myself, no, I’ve just been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen’ nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!」
Harry:「Seen Hermione?」
Professor Trelawney:「Harry Potter! Oh, hello.」
Harry:「My dear boy! The rumors! The stories! ‘The Chosen One’! Of course, I have known for a very long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the subject is of the utmost importance!」
