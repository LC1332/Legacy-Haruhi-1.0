Luna:「But people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!」
Harry:「D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?」
Hermione:「Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry, you can do better than her. Ginny’s told me all about her, apparently she’ll only believe in things as long as there’s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn’t expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.」
Ernie:「I want you to know, Potter, that it’s not only weirdos who support you. I personally believe you one hundred percent. My family have always stood firm behind Dumbledore, and so do I.」
Harry:「Er — thanks very much, Ernie.」
Angelina:「How come you’ve landed yourself in detention for five o’clock on Friday?」
Harry:「Why . . . oh yeah, Keeper tryouts!」
