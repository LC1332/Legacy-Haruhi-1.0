Professor McGonagall:「It’s Cadwallader!」
:Cadwallader scored
McLaggen:「McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone!」
Harry:「You’re not setting a great example!」
Ron:「Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious. She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough.」
Harry:「Yeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who didn’t look like they wanted to be with him, and that’s the second time he’s made sure he isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember? Wish I’d followed him now, the match was such a fiasco. . . .」
Ron:「I never said it was all in your head, but there’s no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place! You’re getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy, Harry. I mean, thinking about missing a match just to follow him . . .」
Harry:「I want to catch him at it! I mean, where’s he going when he disappears off the map?」
