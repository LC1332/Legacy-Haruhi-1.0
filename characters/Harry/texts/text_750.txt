Angelina:「All right, everyone, listen up. I know it’s not ideal weather, but there’s a good chance we’ll be playing Slytherin in conditions like this so it’s a good idea to work out how we’re going to cope with them. Harry, didn’t you do something to your glasses to stop the rain fogging them up when we played Hufflepuff in that storm?」
Harry:「Hermione did it. Impervius!」
Angelina:「I think we all ought to try that. If we could just keep the rain off our faces it would really help visibility — all together, come on — Impervius! Okay. Let’s go.」
:Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upward, the wind pulling him slightly off course. He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practicing; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it.
George:「Mine haven’t, they’re throbbing like mad . . . feel bigger if anything . . .」
Harry:「OUCH!」
