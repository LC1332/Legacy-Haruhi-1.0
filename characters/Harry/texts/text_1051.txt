Malfoy:「looking angrier than Hermione」
Harry:「Time to pack up! And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek!」
Harry:「Sir, I wanted to ask you something.」
Slughorn:「Dumbledore put you up to this. Dumbledore’s shown you that — that memory. Well? Hasn’t he?」
Harry:「Yes, of course, well, if you’ve seen that memory, Harry, you’ll know that I don’t know anything — anything — about Horcruxes.」
Harry:「I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort, didn’t I? Oh, will you get a grip!」
Hermione:「I haven’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do! Not a single one! I’ve been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing! All I could find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile — listen — ‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not speak nor give direction. . . .’ I mean, why mention it then?」
Harry:「Where are you going?」
