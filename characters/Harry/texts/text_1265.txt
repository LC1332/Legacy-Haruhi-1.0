Harry:「“Is it — ?”」
Hermione:「“No, but look!”」
Narrator:Harry think "He stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words KENDRA DUMBLEDORE and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, AND HER DAUGHTER ARIANA. There was also a quotation: Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
Harry:「Look at this!」
Harry:「What?」
Hermione:「It says Ig — Ignotus, I think. . . .」
Harry:「I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?」
Hermione:「It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry. It means . . . you know . . . living beyond death. Living after death.」
Harry:「stop.」
