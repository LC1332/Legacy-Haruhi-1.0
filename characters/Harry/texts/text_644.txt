Mr. Weasley:「Gold, I expect, Malfoy’s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years, Gets him in with the right people, then he can ask favors, delay laws he doesn’t want passed, Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy.」
Harry:「Mr. Weasley, if Fudge is meeting Death Eaters like Malfoy, if he’s seeing them alone, how do we know they haven’t put the Imperius Curse on him?」
Mr. Weasley:「Don’t think it hadn’t occurred to us, Harry, But Dumbledore thinks Fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment — which, as Dumbledore says, is not a lot of comfort. . . . Best not talk about it anymore just now, Harry . . .」
Harry:「Wait . . .」
Harry:「Everyone seems quite relieved, though, considering they all knew I’d get off」
