Moody:「Like my Dark Detectors, do you?」
Harry:「What’s that?」
Moody:「Secrecy Sensor. Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies . . . no use here, of course, too much interference — students in every direction lying about why they haven’t done their homework. Been humming ever since I got here. I had to disable my Sneakoscope because it wouldn’t stop whistling. It’s extra-sensitive, picks up stuff about a mile around. Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff,” he added in a growl.」
Harry:「And what’s the mirror for?」
Harry:「It’s all right. Cheating’s a traditional part of the Triwizard Tournament and always has been.」
Moody:「So . . . got any ideas how you’re going to get past your dragon yet?」
Harry:「No.」
Moody:「Excuse me, you’ve got strengths if I say you’ve got them. Think now. What are you best at?」
Narrator:Harry think "Well, that was easy, really —"
Harry:「Yeah, but . . . I’m not allowed a broom, I’ve only got my wand —」
Harry:「Hermione — I need you to help me.」
