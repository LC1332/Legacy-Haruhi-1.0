Ron:「We were just talking about Mad-Eye. I reckon he might have survived.」
Harry:「But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse.」
Ron:「Yeah, but Bill was under attack too. How can he be sure what he saw?」
Hermione:「Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet. He could have used a Shield Charm —」
Harry:「Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand.」
Harry:「The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why no one’s found him.」
Harry:「Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset —」
Hermione:「“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,”」
Ron:「“I forgot we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”」
Hermione:「“I wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think we’d better take it, to be safe.”」
Harry:「“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to come with me,”」
