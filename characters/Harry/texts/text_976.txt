Ginny:「Did I hear right? You’ve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?」
Harry:「It’s nothing. It’s not like, you know, Riddle’s diary. It’s just an old textbook someone’s scribbled on.」
Ginny:「But you’re doing what it says?」
Hermione:「We ought to check that there’s nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions, who knows?」
Harry:「Hey!」
Hermione:「It seems all right. I mean, it really does seem to be . . . just a textbook.」
Harry:「Good. Then I’ll have it back,」
:Hermione was resolutely plowing on with what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s
Harry:「Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself.」
