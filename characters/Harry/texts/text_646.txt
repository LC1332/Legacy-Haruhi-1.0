Ron:「Booklists have arrived, About time, I thought they’d forgotten, they usually come much earlier than this . . .」
Harry:「Only two new ones, The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 5, by Miranda Goshawk and Defensive Magical Theory, by Wilbert Slinkhard.」
Fred:「We were just wondering who assigned the Slinkhard book, Because it means Dumbledore’s found a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.」
George:「And about time too.」
Harry:「What d’you mean?」
Harry:「One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in a trunk for nine months. Yeah, I see what you mean.」
