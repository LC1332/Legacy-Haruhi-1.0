Sirius:「But Crouch didn’t turn up for the match?」
Harry:「No, I think he said he’d been too busy.」
Sirius:「Harry, did you check your pockets for your wand after you’d left the Top Box?」
Harry:「No, I didn’t need to use it before we got in the forest. And then I put my hand in my pocket, and all that was in there were my Omnioculars. Are you saying whoever conjured the Mark stole my wand in the Top Box?」
Sirius:「The elf wasn’t the only one in that box, Who else was sitting behind you?」
Harry:「Loads of people, Some Bulgarian ministers . . . Cornelius Fudge . . . the Malfoys . . .」
Harry:「No one,」
Harry:「He’s okay, He keeps offering to help me with the Triwizard Tournament.」
