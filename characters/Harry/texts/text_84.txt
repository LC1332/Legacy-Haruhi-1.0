Ron:「I always said he was off his rocker.」
Harry:「So what happened to you two?」
Hermione:「I got back all right, I brought Ron round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him, hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.」
Ron:「D’you think he meant you to do it? Sending you your father’s Cloak and everything?」
Hermione:「if he did — I mean to say — that’s terrible — you could have been killed.」
Harry:「No, it isn’t. He’s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. . . .」
Harry:「I want to go to the feast. I can, can’t I?」
