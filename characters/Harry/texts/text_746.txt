Sirius:「You want to choose your meeting places more carefully, The Hog’s Head, I ask you . . .」
Hermione:「Well, it was better than the Three Broomsticks! That’s always packed with people —」
Sirius:「— which means you’d have been harder to overhear, You’ve got a lot to learn, Hermione.」
Harry:「Who overheard us?」
Sirius:「Keeping an eye on you, of course.」
Harry:「I’m still being followed?」
