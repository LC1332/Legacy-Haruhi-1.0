Ron:「Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to find McLaggen’s red face inches from his own. He stepped back hastily.」
McLaggen:「“His sister didn’t really try,” said McLaggen menacingly. There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernon’s. “She gave him an easy save.”」
Harry:「“Rubbish,” said Harry coldly. “That was the one he nearly missed.”」
McLaggen:「McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this time.」
McLaggen:「“Give me another go.”」
Harry:「“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. Ron saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my way.”」
Harry:「“Well done,” he croaked. “You flew really well —”」
