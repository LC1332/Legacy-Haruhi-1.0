Uncle Vernon:「looked from Aunt Petunia to Dudley to Harry as if hoping somebody was going to shout “April Fool!” When nobody did, he opened his mouth yet again, but was spared the struggle to find more words by the arrival of the third owl of the evening, which zoomed through the still-open window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table, causing all three of the Dursleys to jump with fright.」
Harry:「tore a second official-looking envelope from the owl’s beak and ripped it open as the owl swooped back out into the night.」
Narrator:Harry think "read this letter through three times in quick succession. The miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he was not definitely expelled, though his fears were by no means banished. Everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of August."
Uncle Vernon:「“And they’ll sentence you there?”」
Harry:「“I suppose so.”」
Uncle Vernon:「“NO, IT RUDDY WELL IS NOT ALL!” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “SIT BACK DOWN!”」
Harry:「“What now?” said Harry impatiently.」
