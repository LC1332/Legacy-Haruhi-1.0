Lupin:「You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people? Harry, do you know any of these men?」
Harry:「No」
Lupin:「You see, Severus? It looks like a Zonko product to me —」
Ron:「I — gave — Harry — that — stuff. Bought — it . . . in Zonko’s . . . ages — ago . . .」
Lupin:「That seems to clear that up! Severus, I’ll take this back, shall I?」
Lupin:「Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vampire essay — excuse us, Severus —」
Lupin:「I don’t want to hear explanations. I happen to know that this map was confiscated by Mr. Filch many years ago. Yes, I know it’s a map. I don’t want to know how it fell into your possession. I am, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in. Particularly after what happened the last time a student left information about the castle lying around. And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.」
Harry:「Why did Snape think I’d got it from the manufacturers?」
