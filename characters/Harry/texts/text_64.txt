Ron:「It bit me! I’m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.」
Harry:「It’s Hedwig! She’ll have Charlie’s answer!」
Harry:「We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak, It shouldn’t be too difficult — I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.」
Hermione:「It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday」
Ron:「Midnight on Saturday! Oh no — oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.」
Madam Pomfrey:「Ron needed sleep. It’s too late to change the plan now.」
Harry:「We haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.」
