Sirius:「He was younger than me, and a much better son, as I was constantly reminded.」
Harry:「But he died.」
Sirius:「Stupid idiot . . . he joined the Death Eaters.」
Harry:「You’re kidding!」
Sirius:「No, no, but believe me, they thought Voldemort had the right idea, they were all for the purification of the Wizarding race, getting rid of Muggle-borns and having purebloods in charge. They weren’t alone either, there were quite a few people, before Voldemort showed his true colors, who thought he had the right idea about things. . . . They got cold feet when they saw what he was prepared to do to get power, though. But I bet my parents thought Regulus was a right little hero for joining up at first.」
Harry:「Was he killed by an Auror?」
