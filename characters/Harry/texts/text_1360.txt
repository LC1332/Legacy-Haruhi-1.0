Professor McGonagall:「I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes, also, If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.」
Harry:「The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties」
Professor McGonagall:「Go and wake your students, Horace」
Harry:「He and Luna ran after Professor McGonagall」
Professor McGonagall:「They’re supposed to be, you blithering idiot! Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!」
Filch:「P-Peeves?」
Professor McGonagall:「Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven’t you been complaining about him for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!」
Filch:「Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses」
Professor McGonagall:「And now — Piertotum Locomotor!」
Harry:「Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!」
