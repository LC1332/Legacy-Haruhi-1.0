Quirrell:「Severus? Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn’t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?」
Harry:「But Snape tried to kill me!」
Quirrell:「No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.」
Harry:「Snape was trying to save me?」
Quirrell:「You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.」
Harry:「You let the troll in?」
Harry:「I saw you and Snape in the forest —」
Harry:「But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.」
