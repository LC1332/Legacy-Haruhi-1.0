Hagrid:「She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry, Well, I told her we’d been friends since I went ter fetch yeh from the Dursleys. ‘Never had to tell him off in four years?’ she said. ‘Never played you up in lessons, has he?’ I told her no, an’ she didn’ seem happy at all. Yeh’d think she wanted me to say yeh were horrible, Harry.」
Harry:「’Course she did, She can’t keep writing about what a tragic little hero I am, it’ll get boring., She wants a new angle, Hagrid, She should’ve interviewed Snape, ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .’, Cheers, Hagrid, You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?, No one, yet, said Harry, feeling himself going red again. Hagrid didn’t pursue the subject., It seemed to be fact, however, that he had booked the Weird Sisters. Exactly who or what the Weird Sisters were Harry didn’t know, never having had access to a wizard’s wireless, but he deduced from the wild excitement of those who had grown up listening to the WWN (Wizarding Wireless Network) that they were a very famous musical group., It was amazing how he could make even bloody and vicious goblin riots sound as boring as Percy’s cauldron-bottom report., Evil, he is, Ron said bitterly that night in the Gryffindor common room. Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying., It’s Christmas, Hermione, Like what?, That egg!, Hermione hissed.」
