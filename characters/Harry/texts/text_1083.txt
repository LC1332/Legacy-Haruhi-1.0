Harry:「“I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione. “Shouldn’t he be upset Mundungus has been arrest —”」
Snape:「“But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes fixed on Harry. “Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost.”」
Harry:「“Er — well — ghosts are transparent —”」
Harry:「Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren’t they? So they’d be solid —」
