Dumbledore:「Now, if you don’t mind, Harry, I want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted, old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin’s ring, so he ran off now with Hepzibah’s cup and locket.」
Harry:「But it seems mad. . . . Risking everything, throwing away his job, just for those . . .」
Dumbledore:「Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort, I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.」
Harry:「The locket maybe, but why take the cup as well?」
Harry:「Whose memory is it?」
