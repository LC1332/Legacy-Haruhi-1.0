Hermione:「But what did you see? How do you know?」
Harry:「I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his head, he’s seriously angry, and scared too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check the others are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen getting in, I think he’ll check that one last, but he could still be there within hours —」
Ron:「Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?」
Harry:「No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think about exactly where it is —」
Ron:「But how are we going to get in?」
Harry:「We’ll go to Hogsmeade, and try to work something out once we see what the protection around the school’s like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this time.」
