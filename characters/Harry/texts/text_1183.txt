Ginny:「A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling.」
Harry:「Harry ran forward and seized George’s legs. Together, he and Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the sitting room, where they laid him on the sofa.」
Ginny:「As the lamplight fell across George’s head, Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched: One of George’s ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood.」
Mrs. Weasley:「No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his bulk through the back door.」
Hagrid:「Oi! Le’ go of him! Le’ go of Harry!」
Lupin:「What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts? Answer me!」
Harry:「A — a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?」
