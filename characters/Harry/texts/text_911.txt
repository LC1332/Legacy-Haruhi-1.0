Dumbledore:「Kreacher lied, You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.」
Harry:「He — he sent me on purpose?」
Dumbledore:「Kreacher has been serving more than one master for months. Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas, when Sirius shouted at him to ‘get out.’ He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. He went to Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy.」
Harry:「How do you know all this?」
Harry:「He was laughing?」
Dumbledore:「Like the fact that the person Sirius cared most about in the world was you. Like the fact that you were coming to regard Sirius as a mixture of father and brother. Voldemort knew already, of course, that Sirius was in the Order, that you knew where he was — but Kreacher’s information made him realize that the one person whom you would go to any lengths to rescue was Sirius Black.」
Harry:「So . . . when I asked Kreacher if Sirius was there last night . . .」
