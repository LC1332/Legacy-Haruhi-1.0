Narrator:Ernie think "No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that. That’s probably why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn’t want another Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter’s been hiding?"
Harry:「Hello, I’m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.」
Ernie:「What do you want with him?」
Harry:「I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club.」
Harry:「I didn’t chase it at him! It didn’t even touch him!」
Ernie:「I’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with.」
Harry:「It’s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them. I’d like to see you try it.」
Hagrid:「All righ’, Harry? Why aren’t yeh in class?」
Harry:「Canceled. What’re you doing in here?」
Harry:「It’s nothing. I’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s Transfiguration next and I’ve got to pick up my books.」
