Bagman:「the third and final task of the Triwizard Tournament is about to begin! Let me remind you how the points currently stand! Tied in first place, with eighty-five points each — Mr. Cedric Diggory and Mr. Harry Potter, both of Hogwarts School!”」
Harry:「could just make out Mrs. Weasley, Bill, Ron, and Hermione applauding Fleur politely, halfway up the stands. He waved up at them, and they waved back, beaming at him.」
Bagman:「on my whistle, Harry and Cedric!” said Bagman. “Three — two — one —” He gave a short blast on his whistle, and Harry and Cedric hurried forward into the maze.」
Harry:「pulled out his wand, muttered, “Lumos,” and heard Cedric do the same just behind him.」
