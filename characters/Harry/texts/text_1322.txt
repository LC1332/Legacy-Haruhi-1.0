Ollivander:「I — how? How do you know this?」
Harry:「He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands.」
Ollivander:「He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!」
Harry:「You told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?」
Ollivander:「How do you know this?」
Harry:「Yes, he asked. He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.」
Harry:「But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken beyond repair.」
Ron:「Let’s not worry about that now —」
Ollivander:「The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.」
Harry:「And will it?」
