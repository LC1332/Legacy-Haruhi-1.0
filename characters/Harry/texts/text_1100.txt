:Slughorn said with a hiccup
Harry:「Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing. He was talking about my mum and dad dying.」
:Slughorn looked quite at a loss for what to say
Slughorn:「I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry?」
Harry:「No — well, I was only one when they died. But I’ve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died first. Did you know that?」
:Slughorn gave a great shudder
Harry:「She could have . . . she needn’t . . . That’s awful. . . .」
Slughorn:「Liked her? I don’t imagine anyone who met her wouldn’t have liked her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funny . . . It was the most horrible thing. . . .」
Harry:「But you won’t help her son, She gave me her life, but you won’t give me a memory.」
Harry:「It can, Dumbledore needs information. I need information.」
Harry:「Of course I am.」
