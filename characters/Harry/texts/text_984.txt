Dumbledore:「That old man was — ?」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "Voldemort’s grandfather, yes. Marvolo, his son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several generations before Marvolo was born. He, as you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper, a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son, and rather more than his daughter."
Harry:「So Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she was . . . Voldemort’s mother?」
Dumbledore:「It does. And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s father. I wonder whether you noticed?」
Harry:「The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?」
