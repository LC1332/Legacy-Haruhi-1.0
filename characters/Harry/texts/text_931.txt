Slughorn:「That’s what she did, did she? Idiotic woman. Never liked her.」
Harry:「Sorry, It’s just — I didn’t like her either.」
Dumbledore:「Are you leaving?」
Slughorn:「No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom.」
Narrator:Slughorn think "Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you."
Harry:「Yeah, I’ve been told.」
Narrator:Slughorn think "I was Head of Slytherin. Oh, now, don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done — been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks ago —"
Harry:「Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at school. The whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor! Shame — he was a talented boy. I got his brother, Regulus, when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.」
Narrator:Slughorn think "Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?"
Harry:「Not really.」
