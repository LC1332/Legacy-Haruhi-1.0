Phineas Nigellus:「I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.」
Harry:「Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?」
Phineas Nigellus:「Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!」
Harry:「The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthen them — Harry, that sword’s impregnated with basilisk venom!」
Hermione:「— so he made a copy —」
Harry:「— and put a fake in the glass case —」
Hermione:「Not at Hogwarts,」
Harry:「Somewhere in Hogsmeade?」
Harry:「Dumbledore trusted Snape,」
Harry:「Oh, remembered me, have you?」
Ron:「Problem? There’s no problem,」
Harry:「Well, you’ve obviously got a problem, Spit it out, will you?」
