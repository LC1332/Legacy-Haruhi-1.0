Ron:「You are not」
Harry:「D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up」
Ron:「You’ve got some nerve —」
Harry:「Shut up, both of you! I heard something」
Harry:「How’s your arm?」
Ron:「If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.」
Harry:「He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out.」
Harry:「RUN!」
