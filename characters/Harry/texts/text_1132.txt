Dumbledore:「The idea, as I am sure you will have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury.」
Harry:「Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .」
Dumbledore:「Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable.」
Harry:「I’ll do it, I’m —」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight. A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below. The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness."
Dumbledore:「Let us walk, Be very careful not to step into the water. Stay close to me.」
:Dumbledore set off around the edge of the lake
Harry:「followed close behind him」
