Narrator:Dumbledore think "But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body."
Harry:「But the six Horcruxes, then, how are we supposed to find them?」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them. And I have destroyed another."
Harry:「You have?」
