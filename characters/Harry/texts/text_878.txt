Madam Pomfrey:「Potter, what do you think you’re doing?」
Harry:「I need to see Professor McGonagall. Now . . . It’s urgent . . .」
Madam Pomfrey:「She’s not here, Potter. She was transferred to St. Mungo’s this morning. Four Stunning Spells straight to the chest at her age? It’s a wonder they didn’t kill her.」
Harry:「She’s . . . gone?」
Harry:「I’ve got to tell you something . . .」
Harry:「Voldemort’s got Sirius.」
Harry:「Saw it. Just now. When I fell asleep in the exam.」
