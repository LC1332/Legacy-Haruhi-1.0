Professor Trelawney:「Oh, I got in all right, But there was somebody already in there.」
Harry:「Somebody in — ? Who? Who was in there?」
Professor Trelawney:「I have no idea, I walked into the room and I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of hiding — of using the room, I mean.」
Harry:「A voice? Saying what?」
Professor Trelawney:「I would hazard a guess at male.」
Harry:「And it sounded happy?」
Professor Trelawney:「And then I called out ‘Who’s there?’」
Harry:「You couldn’t have found out who it was without asking?」
Professor Trelawney:「No, it did not, Everything went pitch-black and the next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the room!」
Harry:「And you didn’t see that coming?」
