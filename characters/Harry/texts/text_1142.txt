Dumbledore:「Severus . . . please . . .」
:Snape spell to Dumbledore
Harry:「Harry’s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backward, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.」
Harry:「Out of here, quickly.」
:squat brother and sister followed Snape and Malfoy
Harry:「What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but horror and shock.」
Harry:「Terror tore at Harry’s heart. . . . He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape. . . . Somehow the two things were linked. . . . He could reverse what had happened if he had them both together. . . . Dumbledore could not have died. . . .」
