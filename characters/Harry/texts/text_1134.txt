Dumbledore:「Magic always leaves traces, sometimes very distinctive traces. I taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.」
Harry:「Is . . . is this boat safe?」
Dumbledore:「Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux.」
Harry:「So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if we cross in Voldemort’s boat?」
Dumbledore:「Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat. I think he would have been prepared to risk what was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he is right.」
Harry:「It doesn’t look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both of us? Will we be too heavy together?」
