Dudley:「“He cheeked me.”」
Harry:「“Yeah? Did he say you look like a pig that’s been taught to walk on its hind legs? ’Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true . . .”」
Narrator:Dudley think "A muscle was twitching in Dudley’s jaw. It gave Harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he was making Dudley; he felt as though he was siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin, the only outlet he had."
Narrator:Harry think "They turned right down the narrow alleyway where Harry had first seen Sirius and which formed a shortcut between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. It was empty and much darker than the streets it linked because there were no streetlamps. Their footsteps were muffled between garage walls on one side and a high fence on the other."
Dudley:「“That — that thing you’re hiding.”」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry grinned again."
Dudley:「“You’re not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you’re not. You’d get expelled from that freak school you go to.”」
Harry:「“How d’you know they haven’t changed the rules, Big D?”」
