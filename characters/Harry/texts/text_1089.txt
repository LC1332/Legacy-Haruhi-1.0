Ron:「I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s relatives, to be honest.」
Harry:「He died? But surely werewolves don’t kill, they just turn you into one of them?」
Ron:「They sometimes kill. I’ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away.」
Harry:「What was the werewolf’s name?」
Hermione:「Harry, you’ve got to get that memory. It’s all about stopping Voldemort, isn’t it? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him. . . .」
Hermione:「You’ll do fine.」
Harry:「Good luck.」
