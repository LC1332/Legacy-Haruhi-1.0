Ron:「Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something. I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything past Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget."
Seamus Finnigan:「Harry, you need your strength. Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.」
Harry:「Thanks, Seamus.」
