Professor McGonagall:「What on earth are you shouting about, Potter? Why aren’t you in class?」
Harry:「I’ve been sent to see you.」
Professor McGonagall:「He held out the note from Professor Umbridge.」
Harry:「Is this true?」
Harry:「Yes.」
Professor McGonagall:「Have a biscuit.」
Harry:「What do you — ?」
Professor McGonagall:「It says here she’s given you detention every evening this week, starting tomorrow.」
Harry:「Every evening this week!」
Professor McGonagall:「She is your teacher and has every right to give you detention.」
Professor McGonagall:「Just remember: Tread carefully around Dolores Umbridge.」
Harry:「But I was telling the truth!」
Harry:「No, thanks.」
Professor McGonagall:「Didn’t you listen to Dolores Umbridge’s speech at the start-of-term feast, Potter?」
Harry:「Yeah.」
