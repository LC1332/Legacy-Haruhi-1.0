Ron:「You keep saying that, but one of them can」
Harry:「‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story」
Hermione:「A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already!」
Harry:「I don’t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand」
Hermione:「All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone? No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!」
Harry:「When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad appear . . . and Cedric . . .」
