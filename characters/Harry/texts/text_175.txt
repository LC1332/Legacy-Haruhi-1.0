Narrator:Narrator think "His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him."
Narrator:Aragog think "The thing that lives in the castle is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school."

Harry:「But — but —」
Narrator:Aragog think "I think not. . . ."
Harry:「Get Fang!」
