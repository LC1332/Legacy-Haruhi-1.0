Lupin:「I heard about the match, and I’m sorry about your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?」
Harry:「No, The tree smashed it to bits.」
Lupin:「They planted the Whomping Willow the same year that I arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. No broomstick would have a chance.」
Harry:「Did you hear about the dementors too?」
