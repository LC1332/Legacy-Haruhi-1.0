Harry:「Someone shut the door,」
:Neville obeyed Harry's order
Harry:「What was that about?」
Neville:「How’re we going to get back out?」
Harry:「Well, that doesn’t matter now. We won’t need to get out till we’ve found Sirius —」
Harry:「I don’t — In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room — that’s this one — and then I went through another door into a room that kind of . . . glitters. We should try a few doors. I’ll know the right way when I see it. C’mon.」
Harry:「In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one. I think we should go back and try from there.」
