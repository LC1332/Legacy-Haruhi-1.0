Ron:「So, Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?」
Harry:「Yeah, I s’pose I’d better, said Harry. I don’t reckon I’ll need all of it, not twelve hours’ worth, it can’t take all night. . . . I’ll just take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.」
Ron:「It’s a great feeling when you take it, said Ron reminiscently. Like you can’t do anything wrong.」
Hermione:「What are you talking about? said Hermione, laughing. You’ve never taken any!」
Ron:「Yeah, but I thought I had, didn’t I? said Ron, as though explaining the obvious. Same difference really . . .」
Harry:「the plan being that Harry should go to Slughorn’s office once the teacher had had time to get back there. When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest, they decided the moment had come, and after checking carefully that Neville, Dean, and Seamus were all in the common room, sneaked up to the boys’ dormitory.」
