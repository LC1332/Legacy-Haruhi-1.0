Parvati:「She says I’ve got all the makings of a true Seer. I saw loads of stuff. . . . Well, good luck!」
Harry:「Wish she’d hurry up . . .」
Ron:「How’d it go?」
Ron:「Rubbish, Couldn't see a thing, so I made some stuff up. Don't think she was convinced, though. . . .」
Harry:「Meet you in the common room,」
:Harry Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he could, willing it to show him something other than swirling white fog, but nothing happened.

Professor Trelawney:「Are you sure? Are you quite sure, dear? You don’t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?」

Harry:「S-sorry?」
