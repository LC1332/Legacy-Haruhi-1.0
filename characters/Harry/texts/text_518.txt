Sirius:「All these absences of Barty Crouch’s . . . he goes to the trouble of making sure his house-elf saves him a seat at the Quidditch World Cup, but doesn’t bother to turn up and watch. He works very hard to reinstate the Triwizard Tournament, and then stops coming to that too. . . . It’s not like Crouch. If he’s ever taken a day off work because of illness before this, I’ll eat Buckbeak.」
Harry:「D’you know Crouch, then?」
Sirius:「Oh I know Crouch all right. He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban — without a trial.」
Ron:「You’re kidding!」
Hermione:「You’re kidding!」
Sirius:「No, I’m not. Crouch used to be Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, didn’t you know?」
Harry:「He was tipped for the next Minister of Magic.」
