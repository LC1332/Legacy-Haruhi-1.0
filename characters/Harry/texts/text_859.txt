Hermione:「Well, yes, that occurred to me too, I’ve been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful . . .」
Harry:「Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June.」
Hermione:「Oh, Harry, you didn’t!」
Harry:「Yes, I did. And I don’t regret it either — I didn’t need the gold, and they’ll be great at a joke shop . . .」
Hermione:「said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson」
Harry:「It’s no good nagging me, it’s done, Fred and George have got the gold — spent a good bit of it too, by the sounds of it — and I can’t get it back from them and I don’t want to. So save your breath, Hermione.」
