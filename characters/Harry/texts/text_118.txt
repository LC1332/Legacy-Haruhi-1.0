Ron:「He says he’s done」
Harry:「Whassamatter?」
Wood:「Quidditch practice! Come on!」
Harry:「Oliver, It’s the crack of dawn.」
Harry:「I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I’ve got here! I’ve had it developed, I wanted to show you —」
Colin:「Oh, wow! Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch game before!」
Colin:「You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren’t you, Harry? Weren’t you? You must be brilliant. I’ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?」
Harry:「I don’t really understand Quidditch. Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?」
Harry:「the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goalposts at the end of the pitch — they’re three long poles with hoops on the end.」
