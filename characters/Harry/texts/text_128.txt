Harry:「You do believe me, don’t you?」
Ron:「You know, it rings a sort of bell. I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once . . . might’ve been Bill. . . .」
Harry:「And what on earth’s a Squib?」
Harry:「Midnight, We’d better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.」
