Hermione:「So you — you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?」
Narrator:Ollivander think "No, its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in wizards."
Harry:「you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?」
Narrator:Ollivander think "It was a rumor, years and years ago, long before you were born! I believe Gregorovitch himself started it."
Harry:「What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?」
Narrator:Ollivander think "He was torturing me! The Cruciatus Curse . . . you have no idea. . . ."
Harry:「Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.」
Ron:「Dumbledore had the Elder Wand? But then — where is it now?」
Harry:「At Hogwarts. But then, let’s go! Harry, let’s go and get it before he does!」
Harry:「No. Hermione’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.」
