Dumbledore:「I trust Severus Snape, but I forgot — another old man’s mistake — that some wounds run too deep for the healing. I thought Professor Snape could overcome his feelings about your father — I was wrong.」
Harry:「But that’s okay, is it? It’s okay for Snape to hate my dad, but it’s not okay for Sirius to hate Kreacher?」
Dumbledore:「Sirius did not hate Kreacher, he regarded him as a servant unworthy of much interest or notice. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. . . . The fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie. We wizards have mistreated and abused our fellows for too long, and we are now reaping our reward.」
Harry:「SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?」

Dumbledore:「It is time for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything. I ask only a little patience. You will have your chance to rage at me — to do whatever you like — when I have finished. I will not stop you.」
Harry:「Wait」
