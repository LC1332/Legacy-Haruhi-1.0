Ginny:「I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she’ll be able to delay you leaving,」
Harry:「And then what does she think’s going to happen? Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding us here making vol-au-vents?」

Narrator:Mr. Weasley think "Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again.

It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky,"
Harry:「No news about Mad-Eye?」
Harry:「And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death Eaters?」
