Hermione:「I don’t hate her, I just think she’s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. . . . But Harry’s already missed History of Magic and I don’t think he ought to miss anything else today!」
Harry:「There was too much truth in this to ignore, so half an hour later Harry took his seat in the hot, over-perfumed atmosphere of the Divination classroom feeling angry at everybody.」
Professor Trelawney:「Well, carry on! You know what to do! Or am I such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book?」
Harry:「I think she’s got the results of her inspection back.」
Parvati Patil:「Professor, who’s insulting you?」
Professor Trelawney:「The establishment! Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the Mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know . . . Of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted. . . . It is — alas — our fate . . .」
Harry:「You and Umbridge have got something in common. She obviously reckons Trelawney’s an old fraud too. . . . Looks like she’s put her on probation.」
