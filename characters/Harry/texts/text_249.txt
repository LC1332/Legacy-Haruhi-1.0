Snape:「You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves. I want two rolls of parchment on the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to arrange your detention.」
Harry:「Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, who waited until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape.」
Harry:「Snape’s never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job. Why’s he got it in for Lupin? D’you think this is all because of the boggart?」
Harry:「What did you do that for?」
