Harry:「D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?」
Malfoy:「whoever it was was expelled. They’re probably still in Azkaban」
Harry:「Azkaban?」
Ron:「Ho!」
Malfoy:「Yeah . . . Luckily, they didn’t find much. Father’s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we’ve got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor —」
Ron:「Well, it wasn’t a complete waste of time. I know we still haven’t found out who’s doing the attacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys’ drawing room.」
Harry:「What’s the matter? You must be back to normal by now, we are —」
Ron:「Have you still got Millicent’s nose or something?」
Hermione:「It was a c-cat hair! M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn’t supposed to be used for animal transformations!」
Ron:「Uh-oh.」
Harry:「We’ll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions. . . .」
