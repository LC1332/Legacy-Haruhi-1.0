Hermione:「Oh no, that was horrible. And he might kill them all . . .」
Harry:「I’m not that fussed, to be honest.」
Harry:「Smart plan. Really smart plan. Where do we go from here?」
Hermione:「Well, we can’t do anything without wands. Anyway, Harry, how exactly were you planning to get all the way to London?」
Unknown:「Yeah, we were just wondering that.」
Harry:「Yes!」
Harry:「Yeah.」
Luna:「I think there are six of us, actually.」
Harry:「Don’t be stupid, we can’t all go! Look, you three — you’re not involved in this, you’re not —」
Ginny:「Oh, more of them will come. Because in case you hadn’t noticed, you and Hermione are both covered in blood, and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat, so that’s probably why these two turned up in the first place . . .」
Harry:「Okay, then. Ron and I will take these two and go ahead, and Hermione can stay here with you three and she’ll attract more thestrals —」
Harry:「All right, pick one and get on, then.」
