Uncle Vernon:「growled, “you’ll keep a civil tongue in your head when you’re talking to Marge.”」
Harry:「said bitterly, “if she does when she’s talking to me.”」
Uncle Vernon:「as Marge doesn’t know anything about your abnormality, I don’t want any — any funny stuff while she’s here. You behave yourself, got me?」
Harry:「I will if she does,」
Uncle Vernon:「And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be trouble,」
Harry:「Well, Petunia, I’ll be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, Dudders?」
Uncle Vernon:「See you in a bit, then,」
Harry:「I’m not taking you,」
Harry:「I need you to sign the permission form,」
Uncle Vernon:「You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you?」
Harry:「Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her,」
Harry:「Right,」
:Hedwig looked reproachful
Harry:「Do something about your hair!」
