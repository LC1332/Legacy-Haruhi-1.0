Bagman:「Most of the judges feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks. However . . . Mr. Potter’s score is forty-five points.」
Harry:「Harry’s stomach leapt — he was now tying for first place with Cedric.」
Ron:「There you go, Harry! You weren’t being thick after all — you were showing moral fiber!」
Fleur:「clapping very hard」
Krum:「didn’t look happy at all. He attempted to engage Hermione in conversation again, but she was too busy cheering Harry to listen.」
Bagman:「The third and final task will take place at dusk on the twenty-fourth of June. The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand. Thank you all for your support of the champions.」
Harry:「It was over, he had got through . . . he didn’t have to worry about anything now until June the twenty-fourth. . . .」
