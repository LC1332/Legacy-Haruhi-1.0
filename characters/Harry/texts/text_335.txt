Dumbledore:「This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me . . . the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.」
Harry:「Last night . . . I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my Patronus. I mean, when I saw myself across the lake . . . I thought I was seeing him.」
Dumbledore:「An easy mistake to make. I expect you’ll tire of hearing it, but you do look extraordinarily like James. Except for the eyes . . . you have your mother’s eyes.」
Harry:「It was stupid, thinking it was him. I mean, I knew he was dead.」
