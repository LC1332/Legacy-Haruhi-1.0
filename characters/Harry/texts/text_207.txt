Ron:「Finally! We went to the Leaky Cauldron, but they said you’d left, and we went to Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin’s, and —」
Harry:「I got all my school stuff last week. And how come you knew I’m staying at the Leaky Cauldron?」
Ron:「Dad.」
Ron:「Did you really blow up your aunt, Harry?」
Harry:「I didn’t mean to, I just — lost control.」
Ron:「Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it? Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first, because Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as well!」
Hermione:「Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.」
Harry:「Excellent! So, have you got all your new books and stuff?」
