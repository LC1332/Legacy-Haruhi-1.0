Fred:「Okay, let’s go.」
Harry:「But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon’s voice. THAT RUDDY OWL! I’ve forgotten Hedwig!」
:Ron Put your foot down, Fred! yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon.
Harry:「See you next summer!」
:Weasleys roared with laughter
Harry:「Let Hedwig out, She can fly behind us. She hasn’t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.」
Ron:「So — what’s the story, Harry? What’s been happening?」
Harry:「told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished.」
Harry:「I don’t think he could, I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.」
