Slughorn:「Oh dear, dear, dear, I was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I’ll just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to persuade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later!」
Harry:「He’s got no chance of persuading Snape, This detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else.」
Hermione:「I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!」
Ron:「I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,」
:Hermione anxiously
Harry:「Anything new?」
Hermione:「But how can he have done, Harry? We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we?」
Harry:「Were you? I wasn’t!」
Harry:「Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then, His mother or someone.」
