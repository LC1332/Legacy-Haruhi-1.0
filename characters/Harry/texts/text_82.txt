Quirrell:「Sometimes, I find it hard to follow my master’s instructions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —」
Harry:「You mean he was there in the classroom with you?」
Narrator:Quirrell think "He is with me wherever I go, I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. . . . Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me. He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me . . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me. . . ."
Quirrell:「I don’t understand . . . is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?」
Harry:「What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where it’s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m up to?」
