Mr. Weasley:「We’ve managed to convince a couple of people, though, Tonks here, for one — she’s too young to have been in the Order of the Phoenix last time, and having Aurors on our side is a huge advantage — Kingsley Shacklebolt’s been a real asset too. He’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet.」
Harry:「But if none of you’s putting the news out that Voldemort’s back —」
Sirius:「Who said none of us was putting the news out? Why d’you think Dumbledore’s in such trouble?」
Harry:「What d’you mean?」
Mr. Weasley:「It’s no laughing matter, If he carries on defying the Ministry like this, he could end up in Azkaban and the last thing we want is Dumbledore locked up. While You-Know-Who knows Dumbledore’s out there and wise to what he’s up to, he’s going to go cautiously for a while. If Dumbledore’s out of the way — well, You-Know-Who will have a clear field.」
Harry:「But if Voldemort’s trying to recruit more Death Eaters, it’s bound to get out that he’s come back, isn’t it?」
