Ginny:「Ginny kissed Albus good-bye.」
Harry:「“See you at Christmas.”」
Harry:「“Bye, Al,” said Harry as his son hugged him. “Don’t forget Hagrid’s invited you to tea next Friday. Don’t mess with Peeves. Don’t duel anyone till you’ve learned how. And don’t let James wind you up.”」
:Hermione Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won’t it? It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes your choice into account.
Albus:「Really?」
Harry:「It did for me.」
