Narrator:Snape think "You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making, As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach. Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything. Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar? What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane? For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all copying that down? I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?"
Harry:「I don’t know, sir. I don’t know, sir. I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her? I don’t know. I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her? I don’t know. I think Hermione does, though, why don’t you try her?」
