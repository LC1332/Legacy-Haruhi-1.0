Ron:「You really understand him.」
Harry:「Bits of him. Bits . . . I just wish I’d understood Dumbledore as much. But we’ll see. Come on — Ollivander now.」
Narrator:Harry think "The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave."
Harry:「We were glad to do it.」
Harry:「Can you mend this? Is it possible?」
Ollivander:「No. I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.」
Harry:「Can you identify these?」
