Dumbledore:「Me?」
Narrator:Harry think "You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!"
Harry:「The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though. Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "True. True."
Harry:「So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?」
