Voldemort:「That hurt, didn’t it, Harry? You don’t want me to do that again, do you?」
Harry:「I asked you whether you want me to do that again, Answer me! Imperio!」
Harry:「I will not, I won’t answer. . . . Just answer no . . . say no . . . just answer no. . . .」
Voldemort:「You won’t? You won’t say no? Harry, obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die. . . . Perhaps another little dose of pain?」
Harry:「We are not playing hide-and-seek, Harry. You cannot hide from me. Does this mean you are tired of our duel? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now, Harry? Come out, Harry . . . come out and play, then . . . it will be quick . . . it might even be painless . . . I would not know . . . I have never died. . . .」
