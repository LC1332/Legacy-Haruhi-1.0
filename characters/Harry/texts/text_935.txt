Dumbledore:「Very well, then, I see a light in the kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are.」
Harry:「Hi, Tonks.」
Tonks:「Hi, Harry.」
Mrs. Weasley:「Please don’t leave on my account. I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour.」
Tonks:「No, really, Molly . . . thanks anyway . . . Good night, everyone.」
Mrs. Weasley:「Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry. Take care of yourself. Molly, your servant.」
Dumbledore:「You’re like Ron, Both of you look as though you’ve had Stretching Jinxes put on you. I swear Ron’s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes. Are you hungry, Harry?」
Harry:「Yeah, I am.」
Mrs. Weasley:「Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday. Everyone’s in bed, of course, we didn’t expect you for hours. Here you are —」
Mrs. Weasley:「Bread, dear?」
Harry:「Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.」
Harry:「That’s great!」
