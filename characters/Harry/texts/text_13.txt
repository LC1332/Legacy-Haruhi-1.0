Hagrid:「Might as well get yer uniform, Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.」
Madam Malkin:「Hogwarts, dear? Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.」
Harry:「Hello, Hogwarts, too?」
Boy:「My father’s next door buying my books and Mother’s up the street looking at wands, Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully Father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.」
Harry:「Have you got your own broom?」
Boy:「I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in yet?」
Harry:「No」
Boy:「I say, look at that man!」
Hagrid:「grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.」
Harry:「That’s Hagrid, He works at Hogwarts.」
Harry:「They’re dead.」
