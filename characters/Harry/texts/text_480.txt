Dumbledore:「“Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts’ secrets, Igor. Only this morning, for instance, I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before, containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots. When I went back to investigate more closely, I discovered that the room had vanished. But I must keep an eye out for it. Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning. Or it may only appear at the quarter moon — or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder.”」
Harry:「snorted into his plate of goulash」
Percy:「frowned」
Fleur Delacour:「was criticizing the Hogwarts decorations to Roger Davies」
Harry:「No, I don’t like it,」
