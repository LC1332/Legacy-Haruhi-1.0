Umbridge:「Come here.」
Harry:「Hand.」
Umbridge:「Tut, tut, I don’t seem to have made much of an impression yet. Well, we’ll just have to try again tomorrow evening, won’t we? You may go.」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor then, when he had turned the corner and was sure that she would not hear him, broke into a run."
Harry:「I don’t know how much power McGonagall’s got over her. Dumbledore, then, tell Dumbledore! He’s got enough on his mind.」
Ron:「Well, I reckon you should —」
Fat Lady:「Are you going to give me the password or will I have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation?」
Harry:「Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week. Though Harry glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered the Great Hall, it was without real hope of seeing Hagrid and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problems, such as the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with Umbridge.」
