George:「Mum thought we’d been dueling.」
Harry:「Joke shop still on, then?」
Fred:「Well, we haven’t had a chance to get premises yet, so we’re running it as a mail-order service at the moment. We put advertisements in the Daily Prophet last week.」
George:「All thanks to you, mate. But don’t worry . . . Mum hasn’t got a clue. She won’t read the Daily Prophet anymore, ’cause of it telling lies about you and Dumbledore.」
Harry:「He had forced the Weasley twins to take the thousand-Galleon prize money he had won in the Triwizard Tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop, but he was still glad to know that his part in furthering their plans was unknown to Mrs. Weasley, who did not think that running a joke shop was a suitable career for two of her sons.」
Harry:「Probably looking for a safe place to keep them. Isn’t that what he was doing the night he was supposed to be tailing me? Picking up dodgy cauldrons?」
