Hermione:「But why didn’t he turn you in? I don’t think he wanted to associate himself with that book. I don’t think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if he’d known. And even if Snape pretended it hadn’t been his, Slughorn would have recognized his writing at once. Anyway, the book was left in Snape’s old classroom, and I’ll bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘Prince.’」
Harry:「I should’ve shown the book to Dumbledore. All that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school, and I had proof Snape was too —」
Hermione:「‘Evil’ is a strong word.」
Harry:「You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous!」
