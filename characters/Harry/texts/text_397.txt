Professor Trelawney:「I was saying, my dear, that you were clearly born under the baleful influence of Saturn」
Harry:「Born under — what, sorry?」
Professor Trelawney:「Saturn, dear, the planet Saturn! I was saying that Saturn was surely in a position of power in the heavens at the moment of your birth. . . . Your dark hair . . . your mean stature . . . tragic losses so young in life . . . I think I am right in saying, my dear, that you were born in midwinter?」
Harry:「No, I was born in July.」
