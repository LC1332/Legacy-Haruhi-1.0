Bagman:「There will be obstacles, Hagrid is providing a number of creatures . . . then there will be spells that must be broken . . . all that sort of thing, you know. Now, the champions who are leading on points will get a head start into the maze. Then Mr. Krum will enter . . . then Miss Delacour. But you’ll all be in with a fighting chance, depending how well you get past the obstacles. Should be fun, eh?」
Harry:「Very well . . . if you haven’t got any questions, we’ll go back up to the castle, shall we, it’s a bit chilly. . . .」
Bagman:「I’ll wait for you, Harry, shall I?」
Harry:「No, it’s okay, Mr. Bagman, I think I can find the castle on my own, thanks.」
Krum:「Vill you valk vith me?」
Harry:「Okay.」
Krum:「What’re we going this way for?」
Harry:「Don’t vont to be overheard.」
Krum:「Hermy-own-ninny talks about you very often.」
Harry:「Yeah, because we’re friends.」
