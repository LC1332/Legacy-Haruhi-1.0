Hermione:「What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?」
Harry:「Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.」
Harry:「Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .」
Harry:「What d’you think I’m trying to do? A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . . Okay, try again. . . .」
Harry:「Well, that’s good, just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to suffer.」
Harry:「Just as long as it works tomorrow, The Firebolt’s going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it’s going to be in the castle, and I’m going to be out there on the grounds. . . .」
