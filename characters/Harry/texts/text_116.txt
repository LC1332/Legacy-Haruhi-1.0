Professor Sprout:「As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet. However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I’m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up.」
Colin Creevey:「All right, Harry? I’m — I’m Colin Creevey, I’m in Gryffindor, too. D’you think — would it be all right if — can I have a picture? So I can prove I’ve met you. I know all about you. Everyone’s told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you’ve still got a lightning scar on your forehead and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures’ll move. It’s amazing here, isn’t it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad’s a milkman, he couldn’t believe it either. So I’m taking loads of pictures to send home to him. And it’d be really good if I had one of you — maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?」
Harry:「A picture?」
