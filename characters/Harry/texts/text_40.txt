Ron:「as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bedspread.」
Narrator:Harry think "Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written in gold near the top."
Narrator:Harry think "As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the Quidditch field."
Narrator:Harry think "He’d never been inside the stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high."
Narrator:Harry think "Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he swooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and down the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch."
Harry:「Hey, Potter, come down!」
