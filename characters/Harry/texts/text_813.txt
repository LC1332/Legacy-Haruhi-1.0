Snape:「Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard. While he may feel secure enough to use the name . . . the rest of us . . .」
Harry:「I just wanted to know, why —」
Snape:「You seem to have visited the snake’s mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment. He was possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too . . .」
Harry:「And Vol — he — realized I was there?」
Snape:「I told you, to call me ‘sir.’」
Harry:「Yes, sir, but how do you know — ?」
Snape:「He might. Which brings us back to Occlumency.」
Snape:「Stand up and take out your wand, Potter.」
Harry:「And what are you going to do?」
Harry:「He felt a sharp pain in his knee. Snape’s office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor; one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape’s desk. He looked up at Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.」
