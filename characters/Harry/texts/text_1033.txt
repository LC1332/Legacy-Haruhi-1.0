Ron:「Gits, Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and then we could’ve gone too.」
Harry:「I couldn’t, I promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.」
Ron:「Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other?」
Harry:「Yep, I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too.」
Ron:「’Course, you know what they’ll all say? Dad and Dumbledore and all of them? They’ll say Snape isn’t really trying to help Malfoy, he was just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to.」
Harry:「They didn’t hear him, No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape.」
Ron:「Yeah, I do! Seriously, I do! But they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they?」
Harry:「They didn’t hear him, No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape.」
