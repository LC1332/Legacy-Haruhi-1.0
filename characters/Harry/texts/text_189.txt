Ron:「You’re alive! I don’t believe it! What happened? How — what — where did that bird come from?」
Harry:「He’s Dumbledore’s, said Harry, squeezing through himself.」
Ron:「How come you’ve got a sword?」
Harry:「I’ll explain when we get out of here, said Harry with a sideways glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever.」
Ron:「Back there, He’s in a bad way. Come and see.」
:Fawkes led the way
Gilderoy Lockhart:「His memory’s gone. The Memory Charm backfired. Hit him instead of us. Hasn’t got a clue who he is, or where he is, or who we are. I told him to come and wait here. He’s a danger to himself.」
Ron:「Hello. Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it? Do you live here?」
Harry:「Have you thought how we’re going to get back up this?」
:Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt
Lockhart:「Amazing! Amazing! This is just like magic!」
:Harry heard Lockhart dangling below him
Harry:「There’s no need to sound so disappointed.」
