Ron:「What’s your Quidditch team?」
Harry:「Er — I don’t know any.」
Narrator:Ron think "Oh, you wait, it’s the best game in the world — And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like to get if he had the money."
Three boys:「Is it true? They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?」
Harry:「Yes.」
Narrator:Malfoy think "I’d be careful if I were you, Potter. Unless you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you."
Ron:「Say that again.」
Malfoy:「Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?」
Harry:「Unless you get out now.」
Harry:「You’ve met Malfoy before?」
