Mrs. Weasley:「All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there’s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.」
Harry:「Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,」
Ron:「Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes, like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods. . . .」
Ron:「This is a gnome,」
Gnome:「Gerroff me! Gerroff me!」
Ron:「This is what you have to do, It doesn’t hurt them — you’ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.」
Fred:「Pitiful, I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.」
Harry:「Wow, Harry — that must’ve been fifty feet. . . .」
