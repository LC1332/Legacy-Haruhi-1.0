Hagrid:「“Well . . . yeah . . .” said Hagrid, looking anxious. “See — it’s like I say — he doesn’ really know his strength —”」
Harry:「Harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest.」
Hermione:「“So what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do?” Hermione asked apprehensively.」
Hagrid:「“Look after him,” said Hagrid croakily. “After I’m gone.”」
Harry:「Harry and Hermione exchanged miserable looks, Harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised Hagrid that he would do whatever he asked.」
Harry:「said nothing, but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them.」
Harry:「Grawp had his back to them.」
Harry:「It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head, almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling, close-growing hair the color of bracken.」
Harry:「The legs were curled up under the body; Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor.」
