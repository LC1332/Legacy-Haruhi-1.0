Dumbledore:「And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.」
Harry:「I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir.」
Dumbledore:「Well, you are quite right, because it is not. I have two more memories to show you this evening, both obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, I think, the most important I have collected.」
Harry:「Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the reception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further.」
Harry:「Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him at the orphanage?」
