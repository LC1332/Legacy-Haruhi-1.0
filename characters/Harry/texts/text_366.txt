Dobby:「Did sir just call me Dobby?」
Harry:「Sorry, I just thought you were someone I knew.」
Winky:「But I knows Dobby too, sir! My name is Winky, sir — and you, sir — You is surely Harry Potter!」
Harry:「Yeah, I am.」
Winky:「Freedom is going to Dobby’s head, sir. Ideas above his station, sir. Can’t get another position, sir.」
Harry:「Why not?」
Winky:「House-elves is not paid, sir! No, no, no. I says to Dobby, I says, go find yourself a nice family and settle down, Dobby. He is getting up to all sorts of high jinks, sir, what is unbecoming to a house-elf. You goes racketing around like this, Dobby, I says, and next thing I hear you’s up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, like some common goblin.」
Harry:「Well, it’s about time he had a bit of fun.」
Harry:「Dobby was weirder.」
