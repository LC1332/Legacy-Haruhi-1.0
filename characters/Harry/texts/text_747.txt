Sirius:「Me? Certainly not! I think it’s an excellent idea!」
Harry:「You do?」
Sirius:「Of course I do! D’you think your father and I would’ve lain down and taken orders from an old hag like Umbridge?」
Harry:「But — last term all you did was tell me to be careful and not take risks —」
Harry:「Hermione, this whole thing was your idea!」
Harry:「Hear, hear.」
Harry:「Well, that’s a bit of a problem now, Dunno where we’re going to be able to go . . .」
Hermione:「Well, Sirius, it’s just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school, and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you’d wanted to. But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn’t need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee —」
Sirius:「Fair point.」
Hermione:「Fred and George told me it’s blocked.」
Harry:「Oh . . .」
