Mrs. Weasley:「You must speak clearly, dear. And be sure to get out at the right grate. . . .」
Harry:「The right what?」
Mr. Weasley:「He’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss.」
Mrs. Weasley:「But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?」
Harry:「They wouldn’t mind. Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don’t worry about that —」
Mrs. Weasley:「And your eyes shut. The soot —」
Ron:「Don’t fidget. Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace —」
Ron:「But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.」
Harry:「D-Dia-gon Alley,」
