Hermione:「No it isn’t!」
Harry:「now’s not the moment —」
Hermione:「But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable Material and it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a house!」
Ron:「There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know it can explode at the slightest touch?」
Xenophilius:「The Crumple-Horned Snorkack is a shy and highly magical creature, and its horn —」
Hermione:「Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibly dangerous — I don’t know where you got it —」
Xenophilius:「I bought it, two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now, why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?」
Harry:「We need some help.」
