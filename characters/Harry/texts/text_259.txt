Fred:「Explain, George.」
Narrator:George think "when we were in our first year, Harry — young, carefree, and innocent — well, more innocent than we are now — we got into a spot of bother with Filch. We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for some reason — so he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with the usual — detention — disembowelment — and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous. Don’t tell me — Well, what would you’ve done? George caused a diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer open and grabbed — this. It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know, We don’t reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected what it was, though, or he wouldn’t have confiscated it. This little beauty’s taught us more than all the teachers in this school. You’re winding me up. Oh, are we? I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. Right into Hogsmeade, There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these four but we’re sure we’re the only ones who know about these. Don’t bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it’s caved in — completely blocked. And we don’t reckon anyone’s ever used this one, because the Whomping Willow’s planted right over the entrance. But this one here, this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes. We’ve used it loads of times. And as you might’ve noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-eyed old crone’s hump. We owe them so much. Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers. Don’t forget to wipe it after you’ve used it — — or anyone can read it. Just tap it again and say, ‘Mischief managed!’ And it’ll go blank. So, young Harry, mind you behave yourself. See you in Honeydukes."
