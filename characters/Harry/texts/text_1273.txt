:Hermione panting, coughing, staggering around
Narrator:Harry think "The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron’s hand. The locket was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione’s wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree."
Harry:「“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head.」
Ron:「“No, you should do it.”」
Ron:「“Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?”」
Harry:「“Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed to be you.”」
