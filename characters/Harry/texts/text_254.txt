Ron:「And walked up to school with you floating on it. Everyone thought you were . . .」
Harry:「Did someone get my Nimbus?」
Hermione:「Er —」
Hermione:「when you fell off, it got blown away」
Hermione:「And it hit — it hit — oh, Harry — it hit the Whomping Willow.」
Harry:「The Whomping Willow was a very violent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds.」
Hermione:「tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto the bed, the only remains of Harry’s faithful, finally beaten broomstick.」
Madam Pomfrey:「insisted on keeping Harry in the hospital wing for the rest of the weekend」
Harry:「didn’t argue or complain, but he wouldn’t let her throw away the shattered remnants of his Nimbus Two Thousand」
