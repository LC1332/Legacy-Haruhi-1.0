Hermione:「I want to talk to you, Harry.」
Harry:「What about?」
Hermione:「The so-called Half-Blood Prince.」
Harry:「Oh, not again. Will you please drop it?」
Hermione:「He, he — who says it’s a he?」
Harry:「We’ve been through this. Prince, Hermione, Prince!」
Harry:「No way.」
Hermione:「Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .」
Hermione:「But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!」
Harry:「Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.」
Hermione:「The library. There’s a whole collection of old Prophets up there. Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if I can.」
Harry:「Enjoy yourself.」
