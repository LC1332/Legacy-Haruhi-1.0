Katie Bell:「Library?」
Harry:「I can’t see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library.」

Harry:「But Harry was pretty certain that McGonagall would not be so accommodating this time. For all that Hermione had said about study and homework groups being allowed, he had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious.」
