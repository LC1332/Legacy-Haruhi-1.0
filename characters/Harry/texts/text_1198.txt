Ron:「Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he’d already read that?」
Harry:「He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven. Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think you’re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the information.」
Hermione:「And the more I’ve read about them, the more horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!」
Ron:「Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?」
Hermione:「Yes, but it would be excruciatingly painful.」
Harry:「Why? How do you do it?」
Hermione:「Yes, because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read, what Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.」
Harry:「What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?」
