Neville:「There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that.」
Harry:「You’re worth twelve of Malfoy. The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.」
Neville:「Thanks, Harry . . . I think I’ll go to bed. . . . D’you want the card, you collect them, don’t you?」
Harry:「I’ve found him! I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!」
Ron:「Light?」
Hermione:「Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!」
Harry:「The what?」
Harry:「A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying! No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.」
Hermione:「Ron! Harry!」
Harry:「What? Where?」
