Ollivander:「Hmmm. Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see. Which is your wand arm?」
Harry:「Er — well, I’m right-handed.」
Ollivander:「Hold out your arm. That’s it. Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.」
Ollivander:「That will do. Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.」
Harry:「Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —」
Harry:「Sorry, but what’s curious?」
Uncle Vernon:「Grunt.」
Harry:「Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.」
Uncle Vernon:「Grunt.」
Harry:「Thank you.」
