Harry:「Wood told me.」
Fred:「Well done. Wood told us. We’re on the team too — Beaters.」
George:「I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this year. We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.」
Fred:「Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new secret passageway out of the school. Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.」
Malfoy:「Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?」
Harry:「You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and you’ve got your little friends with you.」
