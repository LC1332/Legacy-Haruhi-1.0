Ron:「Can you smell something?」
Narrator:Narrator think "It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long."
Narrator:Narrator think "The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly into the room."
Harry:「The key’s in the lock. We could lock it in.」
Ron:「Good idea.」
Narrator:Narrator think "Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the passage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was coming from the chamber they’d just chained up."
Ron:「Oh, no.」
Harry:「It’s the girls’ bathroom!」
Harry:「Confuse it!」
:Harry spell to troll's club
Harry:「I don’t think so, I think it’s just been knocked out.」
