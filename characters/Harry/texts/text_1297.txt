Hermione:「So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow, you don’t know anything about him, then?」
Harry:「No, I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’ is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher, it lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.」
Ron:「‘Extinct in the male line’?」
Hermione:「It means the name’s died out, centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they’d just be called something different.」
Harry:「Marvolo Gaunt!」
Hermione:「The Peverell coat of arms? Could you see what it looked like?」
Harry:「Not really, there was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.」
