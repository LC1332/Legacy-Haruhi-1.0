Madam Pomfrey:「What — what happened? Harry? Why are we in here? Where’s Sirius? Where’s Lupin? What’s going on?」
Harry:「You explain,」
Narrator:Harry think "When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noon the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The sweltering heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor Hermione felt like going, however, so they and Harry wandered onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the previous night and wondering where Sirius and Buckbeak were now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its tentacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the thread of the conversation as he looked across to the opposite bank. The stag had galloped toward him from there just last night. . . ."
Hagrid:「Beaky! He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all night!」
Hermione:「That’s wonderful!」
Hagrid:「Yeah . . . can’t’ve tied him up properly. I was worried this mornin’, mind . . . thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds, but Lupin says he never ate anythin’ las’ night. . . .」
Harry:「What?」
