Hermione:「What did you do? Did you get any work done?」
Harry:「No, Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And then Snape came in. . . .」
Ron:「Lupin drank it? Is he mad?」
Hermione:「We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be starting in five minutes. . . .」
Hermione:「But if he — you know if he was trying to — to poison Lupin — he wouldn’t have done it in front of Harry.」
Harry:「Yeah, maybe」
