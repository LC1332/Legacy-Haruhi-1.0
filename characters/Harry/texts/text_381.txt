Hermione:「Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry? Are you expecting a letter?」
Harry:「I told Sirius about my scar, I’m waiting for his answer.」
Ron:「Good thinking! I bet Sirius’ll know what to do!」
Harry:「I hoped he’d get back to me quickly.」
Ron:「Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard, Harry. Come on — three on three, Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play. . . . You can try out the Wronski Feint. . . .」
Hermione:「Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. He’s worried, and he’s tired. We all need to go to bed.」
Harry:「Yeah, I want to play Quidditch. Hang on, I’ll get my Firebolt.」
