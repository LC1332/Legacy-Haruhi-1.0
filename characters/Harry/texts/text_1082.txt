Hermione:「Do you mean to say that that little girl whose scales I repaired — ?」
Harry:「Yeah, of course! Of course! Malfoy must’ve been inside the room at the time, so she — what am I talking about? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too! We’ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it!」
Ron:「He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls? Blimey . . . No wonder they don’t look too happy these days. . . . I’m surprised they don’t tell him to stuff it. . . .」
Harry:「Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them his Dark Mark?」
Hermione:「But, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don’t think you’ll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what’s there first. And I don’t think you should forget that what you’re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn. Good night.」
Harry:「What d’you think?」
