Hermione:「I hate not talking to Hagrid, We’ll go down after Quidditch,」
Harry:「But trials might take all morning, the number of people who have applied. I dunno why the team’s this popular all of a sudden.」
Hermione:「Oh, come on, Harry, It’s not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you! You’ve never been more interesting, and frankly, you’ve never been more fanciable. Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, don’t they? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they’re calling you ‘the Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t you see why people are fascinated by you?」
Harry:「Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.」
