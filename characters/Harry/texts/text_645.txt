Ron:「’Course, once Dumbledore turned up on your side, there was no way they were going to convict you」
Harry:「Yeah, he swung it for me」
Harry:「Scar, But it’s nothing. . . . It happens all the time now . . .」
Hermione:「Don’t you go feeling guilty! You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s being selfish.」
Ron:「That’s a bit harsh, Hermione, you wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without company.」
Hermione:「He’ll have company! It’s headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with him.」
Harry:「I don’t think that’s true, He wouldn’t give me a straight answer when I asked him if I could.」
Ron:「Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.」
Harry:「So you think he’s touched in the head?」
