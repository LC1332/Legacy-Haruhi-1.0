Mr. Weasley:「“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went and searched the Malfoys’ house. There was nothing, either broken or whole, that shouldn’t have been there.”」
Harry:「“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked . . . but this is something different. . . . Well, something more . . .”」
Harry:「And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin’s head turn a little toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there was silence, except for Celestina’s crooning.」
Mr. Weasley:「“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, “that Snape was simply pretending — ?”」
Harry:「“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Malfoy’s up to?” said Harry quickly. “Yeah, I thought you’d say that. But how do we know?”」
