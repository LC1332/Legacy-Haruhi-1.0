Hermione:「You didn’t say you’d written to Sirius!」
Harry:「I forgot, Don’t look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?」
Sirius:「No, it was very good, Anyway, we’d better be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar」
Ron:「What about — ?」
Hermione:「We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius」
Sirius:「Well, I know it can’t be fun when it hurts, but we don’t think it’s anything to really worry about. It kept aching all last year, didn’t it?」
Harry:「Yeah, and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion. So maybe he was just, I dunno, really angry or something the night I had that detention.」
Sirius:「Well, now he’s back it’s bound to hurt more often.」
Harry:「So you don’t think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her?」
