Hermione Granger:「Madam Hooch told us not to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.」
Narrator:Harry think "Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron."
Malfoy:「Oh, yeah?」
Harry:「No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy」
