Mrs. Figg:「Don’t put it away, idiot boy! What if there are more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!」
Harry:「What?」
Mrs. Figg:「He left! Left to see someone about a batch of cauldrons that fell off the back of a broom! I told him I’d flay him alive if he went, and now look! Dementors! It’s just lucky I put Mr. Tibbles on the case! But we haven’t got time to stand around! Hurry, now, we’ve got to get you back! Oh, the trouble this is going to cause! I will kill him!」
Harry:「But —」
Harry:「This bloke Mundungus has been following me? Hang on — it was him! He Disapparated from the front of my house!」
Mrs. Figg:「Of course I know Dumbledore, who doesn’t know Dumbledore? But come on — I’ll be no help if they come back, I’ve never so much as Transfigured a teabag —」
Mrs. Figg:「Get up, you useless lump, get up!」
Harry:「I’ll do it.」
