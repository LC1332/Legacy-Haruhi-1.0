Hermione:「Hmm?」
Harry:「I’ve been thinking, and —」
Hermione:「Harry, could you help me with something?」
Hermione:「Look at that symbol, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story, there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.」
Harry:「I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.」
Hermione:「Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.」
Hermione:「What?」
Harry:「Krum told me . . . He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding.」
Hermione:「That’s very odd. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it doing in a book of children’s stories?」
Harry:「Yeah, it is weird. And you’d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.」
Hermione:「Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I really think we’ll have to.」
Harry:「Did you hear me right?」
