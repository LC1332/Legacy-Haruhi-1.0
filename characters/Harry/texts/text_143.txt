Ron:「A Parselmouth! You can talk to snakes!」
Harry:「I know, that’s only the second time I’ve ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once — long story — but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to — that was before I knew I was a wizard —」
Ron:「A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?」
Harry:「So? I bet loads of people here can do it.」
Ron:「Oh, that’s what you said to it?」
Harry:「What d’you mean? You were there — you heard me —」
Ron:「D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin’s head? What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn’t have to join the Headless Hunt?」
Hermione:「It matters because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That’s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.」
Harry:「Exactly. And now the whole school’s going to think you’re his great-great-great-great-grandson or something —」
