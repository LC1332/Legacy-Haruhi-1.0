Hermione:「We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.」
Harry:「Brilliant. I’ll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.」
Narrator:Harry think "Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin. . . . Maybe he’s lying, Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn’t take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history’s right?"
Harry:「We’ll tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped us get into that vault — but we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it.」
