Tonks:「You know, I don’t think purple’s really my color. D’you think it makes me look a bit peaky?」
Harry:「Er —」
Tonks:「Yeah, it does.」
Tonks:「How did you do that?」
Tonks:「I’m a Metamorphmagus. It means I can change my appearance at will. I was born one. I got top marks in Concealment and Disguise during Auror training without any study at all, it was great.」
Harry:「You’re an Auror?」
Tonks:「Bet you wouldn’t mind hiding that scar sometimes, eh?」
Harry:「No, I wouldn’t mind.」
Harry:「Don’t be stupid, it’ll be much quicker if I — pack!」
