Sirius:「has anyone actually seen Kreacher lately?」
Harry:「I haven’t seen him since the night we came back here, You were ordering him out of the kitchen.」
Sirius:「You know, I think that’s the last time I saw him, too. . . . He must be hiding upstairs somewhere . . .」
Harry:「He couldn’t have left, could he? I mean, when you said ‘out,’ maybe he thought you meant, get out of the house?」
