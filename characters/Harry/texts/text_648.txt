Hermione:「Harry?」
Harry:「Well done, Brilliant. Prefect. Great.」
Hermione:「Thanks, Erm — Harry — could I borrow Hedwig so I can tell Mum and Dad? They’ll be really pleased — I mean, prefect is something they can understand —」
Harry:「Yeah, no problem, Take her!」
:Harry heard the door close, remained bent double, listening
:Harry had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year
:Harry could not lie to himself
:Harry think himself superior to everyone else
:Harry not better at anything else
:Harry Ron and Hermione were with me most of the time
:Harry definitely done more
:Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said
:Harry had not asked Dumbledore to give him the prefect badge. This was not Ron’s fault
Harry:「Cool, Listen — Ron — well done, mate.」
Harry:「It was odd how widely their possessions seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived.」
