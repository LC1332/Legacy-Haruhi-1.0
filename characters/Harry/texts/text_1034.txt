Mr. Weasley:「“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh yes . . . marvelous tune . . .”」
Harry:「“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into the chorus. “Be over soon.”」
Harry:「“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy at the Ministry?”」
Mr. Weasley:「“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know Dumbledore’s tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. . . . I mean, anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as though they’re making some progress, and ‘three arrests’ sounds better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases’ . . . but again, this is all top secret. . . .”」
Harry:「“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a moment, wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called “You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.”」
