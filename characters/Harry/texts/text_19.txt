Ron:「I’m Ron Weasley.」
Harry:「Harry Potter.」
Hermione:「Do either of you know what House you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. . . . Anyway, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.」
Ron:「Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it. Stupid spell — George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.」
Harry:「What House are your brothers in?」
Ron:「Yeah.」
Harry:「You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit lighter. So what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?」
