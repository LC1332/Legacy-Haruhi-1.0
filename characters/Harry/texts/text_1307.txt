This picture looks a hell of a lot like you.” “‘ . . . known to be traveling with Harry Potter,’” repeated Greyback quietly. “What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry’s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar. “I thought you wore glasses, Potter?” breathed Greyback. “Will you summon ’im? ’ere?” said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified. “Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his moment of inadequacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get the girl thrown in!”」
