Ron:「Why didn’t you tell me about the gold?」
Harry:「What gold?」
Ron:「The gold I gave you at the Quidditch World Cup, The leprechaun gold I gave you for my Omnioculars. In the Top Box. Why didn’t you tell me it disappeared?」
Harry:「Oh . . . I dunno . . . I never noticed it had gone. I was more worried about my wand, wasn’t I?」
Harry:「Forget it, all right?」
