Dudley:「“See ya, Big D!”」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again. When their voices had faded once more he headed around the corner into Magnolia Crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of Dudley, who was strolling along at his ease, humming tunelessly."
Harry:「“Hey, Big D!”」
Dudley:「“Oh,” he grunted. “It’s you.”」
Harry:「“How long have you been ‘Big D’ then?”」
Dudley:「“I said, SHUT IT!” said Dudley, whose ham-like hands had curled into fists.」
Harry:「“Don’t the boys know that’s what your mum calls you?”」
Narrator:Dudley think "Dudley said nothing. The effort of keeping himself from hitting Harry seemed to be demanding all his self-control."
Harry:「“So who’ve you been beating up tonight?” Harry asked, his grin fading. “Another ten-year-old? I know you did Mark Evans two nights ago —”」
