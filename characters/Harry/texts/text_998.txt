Hermione:「Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion book of yours?」
Harry:「Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?」
Hermione:「Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic–approved. And also, because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit dodgy.」
Harry:「Well . . . yeah, it was, but so what?」
Ron:「It was a laugh! Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!」
Hermione:「Dangling people upside down by the ankle? Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like that?」
Ron:「Fred and George, it’s their kind of thing. And, er —」
Harry:「My dad used this spell. I — Lupin told me.」
Hermione:「I just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!」
Harry:「If he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?」
