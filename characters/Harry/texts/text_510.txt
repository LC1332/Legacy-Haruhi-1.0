Cedric:「Got lost! Fleur and Krum’re coming now!」
Harry:「Where were Fleur and Krum? Time was getting short, and according to the song, the hostages would be lost after an hour. . . .」
Mermen:「The hostages would be lost after an hour. . . .」
Krum:「He appeared to have transfigured himself — but badly.」
Krum:「He began snapping and biting at her ropes; the trouble was that Krum’s new teeth were positioned very awkwardly for biting anything smaller than a dolphin, and Harry was quite sure that if Krum wasn’t careful, he was going to rip Hermione in half.」
Harry:「Darting forward, Harry hit Krum hard on the shoulder and held up the jagged stone. Krum seized it and began to cut Hermione free. Within seconds, he had done it; he grabbed Hermione around the waist, and without a backward glance, began to rise rapidly with her toward the surface.」
Mermen:「They suddenly stopped laughing. Their yellowish eyes were fixed upon Harry’s wand, and they looked scared.」
Harry:「“You’ve got until three!”」
