Bagman:「Well . . . well, yes, but — come on, Harry — we all want a Hogwarts victory, don’t we?」
Harry:「Have you offered Cedric help?」
Bagman:「No, I haven’t, I — well, like I say, I’ve taken a liking to you. Just thought I’d offer . . .」
Harry:「Well, thanks, but I think I’m nearly there with the egg . . . couple more days should crack it.」
Bagman:「Er . . . no, no, thank you, boys . . .」
Hermione:「He shouldn’t be doing that! He’s one of the judges! And anyway, you’ve already worked it out — haven’t you?」
Harry:「Er . . . nearly,」
Ron:「Maybe Percy’s poisoning him. Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he’ll be made Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation.」
Hermione:「Funny, goblins looking for Mr. Crouch. . . . They’d normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.」
Harry:「Crouch can speak loads of different languages, though. Maybe they need an interpreter.」
Harry:「No.」
