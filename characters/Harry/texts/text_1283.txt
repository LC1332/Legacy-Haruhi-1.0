Ron:「I dunno, Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been a bit hacked off, he was having a laugh or — or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don’t think so, not anymore. He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He — well, he must’ve known I’d run out on you.」
Harry:「No, He must’ve known you’d always want to come back.」
Ron:「Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him? Oh yeah, people are talking about it quite a lot. ’Course, if things were different, it’d be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it’s just something to laugh about for people who didn’t like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke. I don’t know that it’s such a big deal, though. He was really young when they — Our age.」
Harry:「Our age」
