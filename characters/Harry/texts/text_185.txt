Riddle:「I decided to leave behind a diary, preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead another in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work. Well, you haven’t finished it, No one’s died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again —」
Harry:「Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time. . . .」
