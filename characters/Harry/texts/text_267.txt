Hagrid:「Thought o’ jus’ letting Buckbeak go . . . tryin’ ter make him fly away . . . but how d’yeh explain ter a hippogriff it’s gotta go inter hidin’? An’ — an’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the law. . . . He looked up at them, tears leaking down his face again. “I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.”」
Harry:「“Lupin? Listen, if he had this much gold, he’d be able to buy himself some new robes.”」
Ron:「“Yeah, but he likes you, And he was away when your Nimbus got smashed, and he might’ve heard about it and decided to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you —”」
Harry:「“What d’you mean, he was away? He was ill when I was playing in that match.”」
Hermione:「“Don’t bring him in here!”」
Ron:「“Who sent you that?”」
Harry:「“No idea, There wasn’t a card or anything with it.”」
