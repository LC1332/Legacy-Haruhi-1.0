Ron:「They were a birthday present! I offered you one, didn’t I? You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you? They’d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go! They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand? They were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was looking for the map, they’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas, and they’re all spiked with love potion!」
Harry:「What’ve you done to him?」
Ron:「Romilda? Did you say Romilda? Harry — do you know her? Can you introduce me?」
Harry:「Yeah, I’ll introduce you. I’m going to let you down now, okay?」
Harry:「Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him. Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her? Great idea.」
