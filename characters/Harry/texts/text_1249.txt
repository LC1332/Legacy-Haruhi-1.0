Ron:「Blimey, I hope they escaped, I didn’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Azkaban because of us . . .」
Harry:「So, have you got it?」
Hermione:「Got — got what?」
Harry:「The locket! Where’s the locket?」
:Hermione pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron
Ron:「There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since Kreacher had it? I mean, are we sure it’s still a Horcrux?」
Hermione:「I think so, There’d be some sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.」
:Harry turned it over in his fingers
Ron:「Can you feel it, though?」
Harry:「What d’you mean?」
Harry:「Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it, and, little though he wanted to, he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him.」
