Hermione:「No, but there have been more dementor attacks, And an arrest」
Harry:「Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater? No way!」
Ron:「He might have been put under the Imperius Curse, You never can tell」
Hermione:「It doesn’t look like it, It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret plans in a pub」
Ron:「He might have been trying to make out he knew more than he did, Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?」
Harry:「Yeah, that’s him, I dunno what they’re playing at, taking Stan seriously」
