Ron:「All right, Harry? What’s been going on? Why haven’t you been answering my letters? I’ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you’d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles —」
Harry:「It wasn’t me — and how did he know?」
Ron:「He works for the Ministry. You know we’re not supposed to do spells outside school —」
Harry:「You should talk.」
Ron:「Stop gibbering. We’ve come to take you home with us.」
Harry:「But you can’t magic me out either —」
Harry:「If the Dursleys wake up, I’m dead.」
Harry:「But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick —」
George:「No problem. Out of the way, Harry.」
Fred:「A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick, but we feel they’re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.」
George:「So — we’ll get your trunk — you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron.」
Harry:「Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks.」
