Hagrid:「Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron, Bu’ maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. ’Spect Lucius Malfoy would’ve come marchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.」
Harry:「Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn’t; Hagrid’s treacle toffee had cemented his jaws together.」
Hagrid:「Harry, Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve heard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How come I haven’t got one?」
Harry:「I have not been giving out signed photos, If Lockhart’s still spreading that around —」
Hagrid:「Don’ think he did, An’ then I told him I’d never read one o’ his books an’ he decided ter go. Treacle toffee, Ron?」
Ron:「No thanks, Better not risk it.」
Hagrid:「Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,」
Harry:「In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid’s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.」
