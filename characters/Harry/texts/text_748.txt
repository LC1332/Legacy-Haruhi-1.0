Hermione:「A hand had appeared amongst the flames, groping as though to catch hold of something; a stubby, short-fingered hand covered in ugly old-fashioned rings. . . .」
Harry:「Umbridge’s hand was still making snatching movements amongst the flames, as though she knew exactly where Sirius’s hair had been moments before and was determined to seize it.」
Hermione:「Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There’s no other explanation.」
Harry:「You think Umbridge attacked Hedwig?」
:Harry spell to bullfrog
Harry:「It was a very, very close call last night. I just wonder if Umbridge knows how close it was. Silencio!」
