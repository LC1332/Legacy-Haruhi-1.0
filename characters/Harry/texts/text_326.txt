Hagrid:「“Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked.」
Harry:「“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.”」
Fudge:「“We — er — have to read you the official notice of execution, Hagrid. I’ll make it quick. And then you and Macnair need to sign it. Macnair, you’re supposed to listen too, that’s procedure —”」
Harry:「“It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned, shall be executed on the sixth of June at sundown —”」
Harry:「“Buckbeak, move!” Harry hissed.」
Harry:「“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buckbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all.」
