Fleur:「You will ’ave to wait, ’Arry. Zey are both ill, tired —」
Harry:「I’m sorry, but it can’t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately — and separately. It’s urgent.」
Bill:「You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she’s been tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell me anything —」
Harry:「We can’t tell you what we’re doing, You’re in the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We’re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.」
Hermione:「“Harry —” said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook.」
Griphook:「“Break into a Gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position upon the bed. “It is impossible.”」
Harry:「“Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.”」
