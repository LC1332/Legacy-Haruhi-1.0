Hagrid:「Blimey, no. The other spiders won’ let me anywhere near their webs now Aragog’s gone. Turns out it was on’y on his orders they didn’ eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?」
Narrator:Harry think "The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acromantulas: They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid."
Narrator:Hagrid think "Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before! It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there, I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted ter give ’im a nice burial . . . a proper send-off . . ."
Harry:「Professor Slughorn met me coming down here, Hagrid.」
