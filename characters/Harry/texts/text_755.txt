Harry:「This room isn’t just some mad idea of Dobby’s; Dumbledore knows about it too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.」
Hermione:「Dumbledore told you about it?」
Harry:「Just in passing.」
Harry:「I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.」
Harry:「In her office.」
Harry:「Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.」
Harry:「Harry,」
Hermione:「And just look at these books! A Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions . . . The Dark Arts Outsmarted . . . Self-Defensive Spellwork . . . wow . . . Harry, this is wonderful, there’s everything we need here!」
