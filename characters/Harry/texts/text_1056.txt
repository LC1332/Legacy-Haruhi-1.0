Ron:「She didn’t see that, did she?」
Harry:「She’s not here yet.」
Slughorn:「Now drink that up, it’s a tonic for the nerves, keep you calm when she arrives, you know.」
Ron:「Brilliant.」
Harry:「Back to normal, then?」
Slughorn:「I’ve got butterbeer, I’ve got wine, I’ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . . meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas . . . ah, well . . . He can’t miss what he’s never had! Why don’t we open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley’s birthday? Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. . . .」
Harry:「There you are then.」
:Ron half-rose from his chair and then crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was dribbling from his mouth, and his eyes were bulging from their sockets.
Harry:「Do something!」
:Ron twitched and choked: His skin was turning blue.
Harry:「Do something!」
Harry:「Do something!」
Harry:「Do something!」
Harry:「Do something!」
