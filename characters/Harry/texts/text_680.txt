Hermione:「Wood lice. But fairy eggs if they can get them.」
Narrator:Professor Grubbly-Plank think "Good girl, take another five points. So whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of wood lice ready to distract or placate it. They may not look dangerous, but if angered they will gouge out human eyes with their fingers, which, as you can see, are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeballs. So if you’d like to gather closer, take a few wood lice and a bowtruckle — I have enough here for one between three — you can study them more closely. I want a sketch from each of you with all body parts labeled by the end of the lesson."
Harry:「Where’s Hagrid?」
Professor Grubbly-Plank:「Never you mind.」
Malfoy:「Maybe the stupid great oaf’s got himself badly injured.」
Harry:「Maybe you will if you don’t shut up.」
