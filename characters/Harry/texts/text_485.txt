Hermione:「“Well, I thought he must be,” she said, shrugging. “I knew he couldn’t be pure giant because they’re about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about giants. They can’t all be horrible. . . . It’s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves. . . . It’s just bigotry, isn’t it?”」
:Ron looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, but perhaps he didn’t want another row, because he contented himself with shaking his head disbelievingly while Hermione wasn’t looking.
:Harry starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous. starting taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn’t. tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. even threw the egg across the room — though he hadn’t really expected that to help.
Harry:「had not forgotten the hint that Cedric had given him, but his less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that he was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it. seemed to him that if Cedric had really wanted to give Harry a hand, he would have been a lot more explicit. told Cedric exactly what was coming in the first task — and Cedric’s idea of a fair exchange had been to tell Harry to take a bath. Well, he didn’t need that sort of rubbishy help — not from someone who kept walking down corridors hand in hand with Cho, anyway.」
