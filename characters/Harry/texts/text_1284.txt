Ron:「I think Hermione’s right, I think we ought to go and see Lovegood.」
Harry:「It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow, Lovegood’s on your side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they’ve got to help you!」
Hermione:「I’m sure this is important!」
Harry:「But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?」
Hermione:「but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric’s Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know about this!」
Ron:「I think we should vote on it, Those in favor of going to see Lovegood —」
Harry:「Fine, Only, once we’ve seen Lovegood, let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you know?」
