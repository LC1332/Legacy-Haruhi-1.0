Lupin:「And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,」
Harry:「Even Snape?」
Lupin:「Well, Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn’t really expect James to take that lying down, could you?」
Harry:「And my mum was okay with that?」
Harry:「Yeah, okay. I just never thought I’d feel sorry for Snape,」
Sirius:「He WHAT?」
Harry:「Are you serious, Harry? He’s stopped giving you lessons?」
Lupin:「If anyone’s going to tell Snape it will be me! But Harry, first of all, you’re to go back to Snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lessons — when Dumbledore hears —」
Harry:「I can’t tell him that, he’d kill me! You didn’t see him when we got out of the Pensieve —」
Harry:「Is that Kreacher coming downstairs?」
Harry:「Quickly, quickly! Ah, she’s left it open . . .」
