Mr. Diggory:「You were found with a wand in your hand!」
Harry:「Hey — that’s mine!」
Mr. Diggory:「That’s my wand! I dropped it!」
Mr. Diggory:「You dropped it? Is this a confession? You threw it aside after you conjured the Mark?」
Mr. Weasley:「Is Harry Potter likely to conjure the Dark Mark?」
Mr. Diggory:「Er — of course not, sorry . . . carried away . . .」
Harry:「I didn’t drop it there, anyway. I missed it right after we got into the wood.」
Hermione:「It didn’t sound anything like Winky, did it?」
Harry:「It definitely didn’t sound like an elf.」
