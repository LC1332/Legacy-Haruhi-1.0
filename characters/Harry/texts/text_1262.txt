Hermione:「Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d want to go back there, and I mean, Godric’s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor’s birthplace —」
Harry:「Really? Gryffindor came from Godric’s Hollow?」
Hermione:「Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?」
Harry:「Erm, I might’ve opened it, you know, when I bought it . . . just the once. . . .」
Harry:「“Oh yeah . . .”」
Harry:「“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name. “Ginny’s great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.”」
Hermione:「“Harry, what if Bathilda’s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?”」
Harry:「“Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric’s Hollow?”」
