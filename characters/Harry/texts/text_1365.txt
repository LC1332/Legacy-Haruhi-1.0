Hagrid:「Good boy, Grawpy! I’ll see yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!」
Harry:「Blimey, Harry, this is it, eh? Time ter fight?」
Hagrid:「Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave. ‘Yeh got till midnight ter gimme Potter.’ Knew yeh mus’ be here, knew what mus’ be happenin’. Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang. Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac’ly what I meant, bu’ — where’s Ron an’ Hermione?」
Harry:「That is a really good question. Come on.」
Gargoyle:「Oh, don’t mind me . . . I’ll just lie here and crumble. . . .」
Harry:「He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . .」
