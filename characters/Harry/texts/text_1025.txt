Luna:「Oh, it’s been all right, a bit lonely without the D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day —」
Harry:「How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me tonight?」
Luna:「Slughorn’s party? With you?」
Harry:「Yeah, We’re supposed to bring guests, so I thought you might like . . . I mean . . . I mean, just as friends, you know. But if you don’t want to . . . Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends! Nobody’s ever asked me to a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for the party? Should I do mine too? No, that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then.」
