Hermione:「But I don’t think you will, Harry. Malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform into.」
Harry:「There’ll be a way around that. You’ve done brilliantly, Dobby.」
Hermione:「Kreacher’s done well too.」
Kreacher:「The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher, Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear —」
Harry:「Get out of it.」
Ron:「Yeah, it’s great.」
Hermione:「But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of students’? How many people are in on it? You wouldn’t think he’d trust lots of them to know what he’s doing. . . .」
Harry:「Yeah, that is weird. I heard him telling Crabbe it wasn’t Crabbe’s business what he was doing . . . so what’s he telling all these . . . all these . . .」
