Hermione:「Yes, but could you keep your trap shut? You know, the only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of years.」
Harry:「There have?」
Hermione:「The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other.」
Narrator:Hermione think "The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who’s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but — oh, it’s all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than other people’s."
Harry:「But how do you know that those wands — the Deathstick and the Wand of Destiny — aren’t the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?」
Ron:「Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius . . . Mad-Eye . . . Dumbledore . . . my parents. . . .」
Harry:「But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t want to come back, would they? I don’t suppose there have been loads of other stories about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?」
