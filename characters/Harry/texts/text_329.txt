Hermione:「You think you saw his ghost?」
Harry:「I don’t know . . . no . . . he looked solid. . . .」
Hermione:「Maybe I was seeing things. But . . . from what I could see . . . it looked like him. . . . I’ve got photos of him. . . .」
Hermione:「I know it sounds crazy.」
Narrator:Harry think "He was thinking about his father and about his three oldest friends . . . Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. . . . Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was dead. . . . Was it so impossible his father had done the same? Had he been seeing things across the lake? The figure had been too far away to see distinctly . . . yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before he’d lost consciousness. . . .The leaves overhead rustled faintly in the breeze. The moon drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds."
Harry:「He had no thought in his head except his father. . . . If it was him . . . if it really was him . . . he had to know, had to find out. . . .」
