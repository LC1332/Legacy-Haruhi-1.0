Bellatrix:「Shut your mouth! You dare speak his name with your unworthy lips, you dare besmirch it with your half-blood’s tongue, you dare —」
Harry:「Did you know he’s a half-blood too? Voldemort? Yeah, his mother was a witch but his dad was a Muggle — or has he been telling you lot he’s pureblood?」
:Bellatrix spell to Harry
Harry:「NO!」
Harry:「You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m supposed to be handing over. I’m not playing games.」
Harry:「Did he? So he wanted me to come and get it, did he? Why? Why did he want to steal a prophecy about me? Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me? And he’s made me come and get it for him? Why couldn’t he come and get it himself?」
Bellatrix:「The Dark Lord, walk into the Ministry of Magic, when they are so sweetly ignoring his return? The Dark Lord, reveal himself to the Aurors, when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin? So he’s got you doing his dirty work for him, has he? Like he tried to get Sturgis to steal it — and Bode?」
Harry:「NOW!」
