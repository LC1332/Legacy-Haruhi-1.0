Hermione:「How’re you feeling?」
Harry:「Fine.」
Hermione:「Oh, don’t lie, Harry. Ron and Ginny say you’ve been hiding from everyone since you got back from St. Mungo’s.」
Harry:「They do, do they?」
Hermione:「Maybe you’re taking it in turns to look and keep missing each other.」
Harry:「Very funny.」
Ginny:「We wanted to talk to you, Harry, but as you’ve been hiding ever since we got back —」
Harry:「I didn’t want anyone to talk to me.」
Ginny:「Lucky you.」
Harry:「I’m sorry.」
Harry:「No.」
Hermione:「Harry, you’ve had these dreams before. You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.」
Harry:「This was different. I was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake. . . . What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London — ?」
Harry:「thinking」
