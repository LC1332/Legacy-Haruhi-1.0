Dumbledore:「Well, Harry . . . time for us to be off. Until we meet again.」
Harry:「Bye.」
Dumbledore:「We do not want to be encumbered by these just now. I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak . . . just in case.」
:Harry extracted his Cloak from his trunk
Dumbledore:「Keep your wand at the ready, Harry.」
Harry:「But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?」
Dumbledore:「You are with me. This will do, Harry.」
Dumbledore:「You have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test.」
Harry:「No. I thought you had to be seventeen?」
Harry:「Are you all right?」
Dumbledore:「This way.」
Dumbledore:「So tell me, Harry. Your scar . . . has it been hurting at all?」
Harry:「No, and I’ve been wondering about that. I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemort’s getting so powerful again.」
Harry:「Professor?」
