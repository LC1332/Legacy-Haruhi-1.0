Lupin:「Harry! What are you — what’s happened, is everything all right?」
Harry:「Yeah, I just wondered — I mean, I just fancied a — a chat with Sirius.」
Lupin:「I’ll call him, he went upstairs to look for Kreacher, he seems to be hiding in the attic again . . .」
Sirius:「What is it? Are you all right? Do you need help?」
Harry:「No, it’s nothing like that. . . . I just wanted to talk . . . about my dad . . .」
Harry:「Yeah, but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because — well, just because you said you were bored,」
Sirius:「If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,」
Lupin:「He kept messing up his hair,」
Sirius:「Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape? Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?」
Sirius:「Yeah, well, you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes. . . . That was something . . .」
Harry:「And he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!」
