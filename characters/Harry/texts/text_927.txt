Uncle Vernon:「He’s been left a house?」
Harry:「You can keep using it as headquarters. I don’t care. You can have it, I don’t really want it.」
Dumbledore:「That is generous. We have, however, vacated the building temporarily.」
Dumbledore:「Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the name of ‘Black.’ Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house, it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood.」
Harry:「I bet there has, Quite, No, But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to own it?, I don’t care, Kreacher, shut up!」
