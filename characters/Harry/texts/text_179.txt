Ron:「D’you know what? I think we should go and see Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going to try and get into the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it’s a basilisk in there.」
Harry:「Professor, we’ve got some information for you. We think it’ll help you.」
Harry:「Are you going somewhere?」
Lockhart:「Well, as to that — most unfortunate — No one regrets more than I —」
Harry:「You can’t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!」
Lockhart:「Books can be misleading.」
Harry:「You wrote them!」
