Harry:「Go on, Harry, take it! You saved Dad’s life, if anyone’s got the right to eavesdrop on him it’s you . . .」
Fred:「Grinning in spite of himself, Harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear as the twins had done.」
Fred:「The flesh-colored strings wriggled like long skinny worms, then snaked under the door.」
Harry:「For a few seconds Harry could hear nothing, then he heard Tonks whispering as clearly as though she were standing right beside him. “. . . they searched the whole area but they couldn’t find the snake anywhere, it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you, Arthur. . . . But You-Know-Who can’t have expected a snake to get in, can he?”」
