Phineas Nigellus:「Who else is here? Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!」
Harry:「They weren’t thieving. That sword isn’t Snape’s.」
Phineas Nigellus:「It belongs to Professor Snape’s school. Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!」
Hermione:「Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!」
Phineas Nigellus:「Where am I? Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?」
Harry:「How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?」
Harry:「Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!」
Harry:「Don’t call Hermione simple.」
