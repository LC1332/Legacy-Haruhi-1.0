Ron:「But that was all your savings!」
Narrator:George think "Tell me about it, ’Course, we found out what was going on in the end. Lee Jordan’s dad had had a bit of trouble getting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he’s in big trouble with the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them cornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the gold he had, and it still wasn’t enough to cover all his debts. They followed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He’s lost everything gambling. Hasn’t got two Galleons to rub together. And you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?"
Harry:「How?」
Fred:「Put a bet on you, mate, Put a big bet on you to win the tournament. Bet against the goblins.」
Harry:「So that’s why he kept trying to help me win! Well — I did win, didn’t I? So he can pay you your gold!」
