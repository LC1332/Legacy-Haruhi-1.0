Dumbledore:「The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance.」
Harry:「So, the other Horcruxes? Do you think you know what they are, sir?」
Dumbledore:「I can only guess. For the reasons I have already given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore trawled back through Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him.」
Harry:「The locket! Hufflepuff’s cup!」
Harry:「My thoughts precisely. But unfortunately, that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders’ objects. He definitely had two — he may have found three — that is the best we can do for now.」
Harry:「The snake? You can use animals as Horcruxes?」
Dumbledore:「An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes.」
Harry:「So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you’ve been going when you’ve been leaving the school?」
