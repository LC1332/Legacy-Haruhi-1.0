Ron:「If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked., That was some catch you made. Malfoy’s face . . . he looked ready to kill. . . ., I want to know how he fixed that Bludger, I hope it tastes better than this stuff. . . ., If it’s got bits of Slytherins in it? You’ve got to be joking, Unbelievable flying, Harry, Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn’t seem too happy.」
Harry:「No, But it doesn’t do anything else either., I’ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy., We can add that to the list of questions we’ll ask him when we’ve taken the Polyjuice Potion, I hope it tastes better than this stuff. . . ., Get off!, What’re you doing here?, And how did you know I missed the train?, It was you!, You stopped the barrier from letting us through!, You’re in for a rough night」
