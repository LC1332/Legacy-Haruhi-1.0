Hermione:「So I took it out and it didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light appeared right outside the window.」
:Ron light appeared outside the window
Narrator:Ron think "It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you know?"
Harry:「Yeah」
Narrator:Ron think "I knew this was it. I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden."
Narrator:Ron think "The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it . . . well, it went inside me."
Harry:「Sorry?」
