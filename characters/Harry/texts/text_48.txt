Hagrid:「Why would Snape do somethin’ like that?」
Harry:「I found out something about him, He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.」
Hagrid:「How do you know about Fluffy?」
Harry:「But Snape’s trying to steal it.」
Harry:「Aha! so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?」
Malfoy:「I do feel so sorry for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.」
Harry:「ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.」
