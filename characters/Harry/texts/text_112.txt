McGonagall:「And speaking of Gryffindor —」
Harry:「Professor, when we took the car, term hadn’t started, so — so Gryffindor shouldn’t really have points taken from it — should it?」
McGonagall:「I will not take any points from Gryffindor. But you will both get a detention.」
McGonagall:「You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory. I must also return to the feast.」
Ron:「I thought we’d had it.」
Harry:「So did I.」
Ron:「She didn’t want us showing off. Doesn’t want people to think it’s clever, arriving by flying car.」
Hermione:「There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous rumors — someone said you’d been expelled for crashing a flying car —」
Harry:「Well, we haven’t been expelled.」
