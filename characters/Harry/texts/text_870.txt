Hagrid:「Ah, you heard what they said. They wouldn’t hurt foals — I mean, kids. Anyway, we can’ let ourselves be pushed around by that lot . . .」
Harry:「Nice try」
:Hermione looked crestfallen
Hagrid:「Was that another goal? Or d’you reckon the match is over?」
Harry:「I don’t know」
Hagrid:「I reckon it’s over, yeh know! Look — there’s people comin’ out already — if you two hurry yeh’ll be able ter blend in with the crowd an’ no one’ll know you weren’t there!」
Harry:「Good idea. Well . . . see you later, then, Hagrid . . .」
Hermione:「A giant! A giant in the forest! And we’re supposed to give him English lessons! Always assuming, of course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out! I — don’t — believe — him!」
Harry:「We haven’t got to do anything yet! He’s not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen —」
:Hermione eyes filled slowly with tears
Harry:「You didn’t mean that」
