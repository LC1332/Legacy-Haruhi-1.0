Hermione:「You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams, because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again . . .」
Harry:「Harry threw Ron a furious look. Ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself. You were only muttering a bit, he mumbled apologetically. Something about ‘just a bit farther.’」
Narrator:Harry think "I dreamed I was watching you lot play Quidditch, I was trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the Quaffle."
Hermione:「You are trying to block your mind, aren’t you? You are keeping going with your Occlumency?」
Harry:「Of course I am, said Harry, trying to sound as though this question was insulting, but not quite meeting her eye. The truth was that he was so intensely curious about what was hidden in that room full of dusty orbs that he was quite keen for the dreams to continue.」
Harry:「Yeah, that’s right,」
Hermione:「Cho will be playing, won’t she?」
Harry:「grunted」
Harry:「Er . . . can’t it wait, Hagrid? asked Harry. Till the match is over?」
