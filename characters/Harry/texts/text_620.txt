Sirius:「Okay, Harry . . . what do you want to know?」
Harry:「Where’s Voldemort? What’s he doing? I’ve been trying to watch the Muggle news, and there hasn’t been anything that looks like him yet, no funny deaths or anything —」
Sirius:「That’s because there haven’t been any suspicious deaths yet, not as far as we know, anyway. . . . And we know quite a lot.」
Lupin:「More than he thinks we do anyway.」
Harry:「How come he’s stopped killing people?」
Harry:「How?」
Harry:「How has that helped?」
Harry:「So what’s the Order been doing?」
Lupin:「Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea, and Dumbledore’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.」
Harry:「So what does Dumbledore reckon he’s planning?」
Lupin:「We’re doing our best.」
Harry:「How?」
