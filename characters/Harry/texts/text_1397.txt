Voldemort:「You dare — ?」
Harry:「Yes, I dare, because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.」
Narrator:Voldemort think "That wand still isn’t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore."
Harry:「Aren’t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore’s death was planned between them! Dumbledore intended to die undefeated, the wand’s last true master! If all had gone as planned, the wand’s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from him!」
