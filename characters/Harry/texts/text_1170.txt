Dudley:「I don’t think you’re a waste of space」
Harry:「Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley」
Dudley:「You saved my life.」
Harry:「Not really, It was your soul the dementor would have taken. . . .」
Hestia Jones:「He only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!」
Harry:「Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’」
Hestia:「Our thoughts go with you.」
Diggle:「Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums.」
Dudley:「See you, Harry.」
Harry:「Maybe. Take care, Big D.」
Harry:「Don’t you want to take a last look at the place? We’ll never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories . . . Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the dementors. . . . Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And last summer, Dumbledore walked through that front door. . . .」
Harry:「There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby.」
