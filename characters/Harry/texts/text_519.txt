Sirius:「What’s the time?」
Harry:「It’s half past three.」
Sirius:「You’d better get back to school.」
Sirius:「Now listen . . . I don’t want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? Just send notes to me here. I still want to hear about anything odd. But you’re not to go leaving Hogwarts without permission; it would be an ideal opportunity for someone to attack you.」
Harry:「No one’s tried to attack me so far, except a dragon and a couple of grindylows.」
