Harry:「Okay, I thought this evening we should just go over the things we’ve done so far, because it’s the last meeting before the holidays and there’s no point starting anything new right before a three-week break —」
Zacharias Smith:「We’re not doing anything new? If I’d known that, I wouldn’t have come . . .」
Fred:「We’re all really sorry Harry didn’t tell you, then.」

Cho:「No, you go on」
Cho:「I’m — sorry, I suppose . . . it’s just . . . learning all this stuff. . . . It just makes me . . . wonder whether . . . if he’d known it all . . . he’d still be alive . . .」
Harry:「He did know this stuff, He was really good at it, or he could never have got to the middle of that maze. But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don’t stand a chance.」
