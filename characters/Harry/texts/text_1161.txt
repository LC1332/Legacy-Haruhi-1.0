Harry:「What’ve you done to him?」

Ginny:「no longer crying, met Harry’s gaze with a hard, blazing look」
Harry:「Ginny, listen . . . I can’t be involved with you anymore. We’ve got to stop seeing each other. We can’t be together.」

Harry:「Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He’s already used you as bait once, and that was just because you’re my best friend’s sister. Think how much danger you’ll be in if we keep this up. He’ll know, he’ll find out. He’ll try and get to me through you.」
