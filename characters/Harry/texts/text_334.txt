Dumbledore:「Why so miserable, Harry? he said quietly. You should be very proud of yourself after last night.」
Harry:「It didn’t make any difference, said Harry bitterly. Pettigrew got away.」
Dumbledore:「Didn’t make any difference? said Dumbledore quietly. It made all the difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.」
Harry:「Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very — very strange.」
Dumbledore:「Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been, he said thoughtfully. Who’d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise. . . .」
Harry:「But — Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore take this so calmly?」
Harry:「But if he helps Voldemort back to power — !」
