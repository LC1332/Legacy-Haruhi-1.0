Ron:「Well, as I’m not invited to any parties, I think I’ll go to bed.」
Harry:「Harry? I’ve got a message for you. From Professor Snape. He says you’re to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention — er — no matter how many party invitations you’ve received. And he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and — and he says there’s no need to bring protective gloves.」
Demelza:「Right, Thanks a lot, Demelza.」
Harry:「Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing?」
Harry:「Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.」
Harry:「The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.」
