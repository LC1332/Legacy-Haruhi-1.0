Dumbledore:「This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.」
Harry:「And what are we doing here?」
Dumbledore:「Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you. Well, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.」
Harry:「How can I help with that, sir?」
