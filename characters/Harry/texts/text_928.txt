Dumbledore:「Well, that simplifies matters. It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.」
Harry:「Do I — do I have to keep him with me?」
Dumbledore:「Not if you don’t want to. If I might make a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye on him.」
Harry:「Yeah, yeah, I’ll do that. Er — Kreacher — I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves.」
Harry:「No, he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.」
Dumbledore:「Doubtful that I would turn up?」
Harry:「I’ll just go and — er — finish off.」
