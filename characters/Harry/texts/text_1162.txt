Ginny:「I never really gave up on you. Not really. I always hoped. . . . Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more — myself.」
Harry:「Smart girl, that Hermione. I just wish I’d asked you sooner. We could’ve had ages . . . months . . . years maybe. . . .」
Ginny:「But you’ve been too busy saving the Wizarding world. Well . . . I can’t say I’m surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn’t be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that’s why I like you so much.」
:Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her
:Harry Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still, just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it
Harry:「No」
Harry:「What do you want?」
