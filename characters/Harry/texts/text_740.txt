Professor Grubbly-Plank:「Hmm, Looks like something’s attacked her. Can’t think what would have done it, though. . . . Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid’s got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls . . .」
Harry:「Harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right.」
Professor McGonagall:「Do you know how far this owl’s traveled, Potter?」
Harry:「From London, I think.」
Professor Grubbly-Plank:「No problem,」
Professor McGonagall:「Just a moment, Wilhelmina! Potter’s letter!」
Harry:「Oh yeah!」
Ron:「Is Hedwig okay?」
Hermione:「Where did you take her?」
Harry:「To Grubbly-Plank, And I met McGonagall . . . Listen . . .」
