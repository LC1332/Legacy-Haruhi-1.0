Hermione:「Listen, Harry, This is really important. . . . Do you think you could meet me in the Three Broomsticks around midday?」
Harry:「Well . . . I dunno, Cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her. We never said what we were going to do.」
Hermione:「Well, bring her along if you must, but will you come?」
Harry:「Well . . . all right, but why?」
Harry:「It’s because you’re good when you’re on form, that’s why」
Cho:「You really miss it, don’t you?」
Harry:「Yeah, I do.」
Cho:「And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to. I heard he got taken on by Pride of Portree, is that right?」
Hermione:「Nah, it was Puddlemere United, I saw him at the World Cup last year.」
Harry:「Oh, I saw you there too, remember? We were on the same campsite. It was really good, wasn’t it?」
Harry:「So . . . where d’you want to go?」
