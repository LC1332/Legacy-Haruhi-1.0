Hermione:「“Hello, Myrtle, how are you?”」
Harry:「“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously. “They’re not girls.”」
Hermione:「“No,” Hermione agreed. “I just wanted to show them how — er — nice it is in here.”」
Harry:「“Ask her if she saw anything,” Harry mouthed at Hermione.」
Myrtle:「“I wish people would stop talking behind my back!” said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. “I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead —”」
Hermione:「“Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,” said Hermione. “Harry only —”」
Myrtle:「“No one wants to upset me! That’s a good one!” howled Myrtle. “My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!”」
Hermione:「We wanted to ask you if you’ve seen anything funny lately, Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.」
Harry:「Did you see anyone near here that night?」
