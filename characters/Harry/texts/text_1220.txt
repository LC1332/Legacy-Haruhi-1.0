Hermione:「“Harry? Harry! Harry!”」
Harry:「“I’m here!” he called. “What’s happened?”」
Hermione:「“We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breathlessly. She turned and shouted over her shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found him!”」
Ron:「“Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!”」
Hermione:「“Harry, don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room. “What have you been doing?”」
Harry:「“Look what I’ve just found.” He held out his mother’s letter.」
Harry:「“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but it’s not here.”」
Harry:「But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was in the Order, wasn’t he?」
Harry:「Bathilda Bagshot, the author of — A History of Magic. So your parents knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.」
Harry:「It’s not just that. Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth. . . .」
