Ginny:「I can’t, I’m going with Neville. He asked me when Hermione said no, and I thought . . . well . . . I’m not going to be able to go otherwise, I’m not in fourth year. I think I’ll go and have dinner.」
Harry:「What’s got into them?」
Harry:「Parvati? Will you go to the ball with me?」
Parvati:「She’s going with Seamus.」
Harry:「Can’t you think of anyone who’d go with Ron?」
Parvati:「Ooooh — who?」
Harry:「No idea. So what about Ron?」
Harry:「this ball was a lot more trouble than it was worth, and hoping very much that Padma Patil’s nose was dead center.」
