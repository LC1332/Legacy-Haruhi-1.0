Ernie:「I think we should get out of here, you know, Just in case . . .」
Harry:「The headmistress would like to see you, Potter,」
Filch:「Things are changing around here, Potter.」
Narrator:Harry think "Umbridge had obviously gone to some lengths to get Filch on her side, and the worst of it was that he would probably prove an important weapon; his knowledge of the school’s secret passageways and hiding places was probably second only to the Weasley twins."
Filch:「Not at all, ma’am, not at all.」
Umbridge:「Sit.」
Harry:「Thank you.」
Umbridge:「I wish you to have a drink with me, Choose one.」
Harry:「Fine . . . tea then.」
Umbridge:「You’re not drinking up!」
Harry:「No.」
Umbridge:「Drink up, drink up, Now then . . . Where is Albus Dumbledore?」
Harry:「No idea.」
Umbridge:「Very well, In that case, you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of Sirius Black.」
Harry:「I don’t know.」
