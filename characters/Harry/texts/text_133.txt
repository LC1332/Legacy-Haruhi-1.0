Ron:「Of course I am! You heard him — ‘You’ll be next, Mudbloods!’ — come on, you’ve only got to look at his foul rat face to know it’s him —」
Harry:「Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?」
Hermione:「Look at his family, The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he’s always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin’s descendants. His father’s definitely evil enough.」
Ron:「They could’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries! Handing it down, father to son. . . .」
Hermione:「Well, I suppose it’s possible. . . .」
Harry:「But how do we prove it?」
Hermione:「All right, What we’d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it’s us.」
Harry:「But that’s impossible.」
Ron:「What’s that?」
Harry:「Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —」
