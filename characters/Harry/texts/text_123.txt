Filch:「That Vanishing Cabinet was extremely valuable! We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet —」
Harry:「Have you — did you read — ?」
Filch:「If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s mine — for a friend — be that as it may — however —」
Harry:「No」
Nearly Headless Nick:「I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch’s office. Thought it might distract him —」
Harry:「Yeah, it worked, I didn’t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!」
Narrator:Nearly Headless Nick think "Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday. I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend.

Harry:「No, I’ll come —」
