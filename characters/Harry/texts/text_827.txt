Hermione:「You should have told her differently, You should have said it was really annoying, but I’d made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn’t want to go, you’d much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you, and hopefully you’d be able to get away more quickly? And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too,」
Harry:「But I don’t think you’re ugly,」
Hermione:「Harry, you’re worse than Ron. . . . Well, no, you’re not, Look — you upset Cho when you said you were going to meet me, so she tried to make you jealous. It was her way of trying to find out how much you liked her,」
Harry:「Is that what she was doing? Well, wouldn’t it have been easier if she’d just asked me whether I liked her better than you?」
Hermione:「I’m not saying what she did was sensible, I’m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time,」
Ron:「You should write a book, translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them,」
Harry:「Yeah, So, how was Quidditch practice?」
