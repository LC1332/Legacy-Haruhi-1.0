McGonagall:「What’s this, Potter? Detention? From whom?」
Harry:「From Professor Umbridge.」
McGonagall:「Are you telling me that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge’s class again?」
Harry:「Yes.」
McGonagall:「Because detentions do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever! No, not another word of complaint, Potter! And as for you, Miss Johnson, you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy!」
Harry:「She’s taken points off Gryffindor because I’m having my hand sliced open every night! How is that fair, how?」
