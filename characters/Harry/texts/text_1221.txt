Hermione:「Harry, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!」
Harry:「I thought I did.」
Hermione:「But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?」
Hermione:「Shall we go down to the kitchen? Find something for breakfast?」
Harry:「Hermione, Come back up here.」
Hermione:「Sirius’s brother?」
Harry:「He was a Death Eater, Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed him.」
Ron:「What’s up? If it’s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I —」
Ron:「What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus Arcturus . . . Regulus . . . R.A.B.! The locket — you don’t reckon — ?」
Harry:「Let’s find out.」
