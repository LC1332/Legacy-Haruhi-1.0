Hermione:「“Harry?” Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face streaked with tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky under her arm. “Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups. “Do you mind if I talk to you?” “No,” he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. “Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well . . . I’ve got the book.” Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. “Where — how — ?” “It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note was sticking out of the top of it.” Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud. “‘Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here’s a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said everything, even if you don’t remember it. Rita.’ I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but perhaps she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?” “No, she probably wasn’t.” Harry looked down upon Dumbledore’s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure: Now he would know all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether Dumbledore wanted him to or not. “You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. “No,” he said quietly. “No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible. I’d be dead if you hadn’t been there to help me.”」
:Harry action
Harry:「Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as though she could not believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. “Grindelwald?”」
