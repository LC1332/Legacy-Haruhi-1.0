Hermione:「That’s because they’re uneducated and brainwashed!」
Harry:「Nice try, Harry. I’m back in the country and well hidden. I want you to keep me posted on everything that’s going on at Hogwarts. Don’t use Hedwig, keep changing owls, and don’t worry about me, just watch out for yourself. Don’t forget what I said about your scar.」
Ron:「Why d’you have to keep changing owls?」
Hermione:「Hedwig’ll attract too much attention. She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s hiding . . . I mean, they’re not native birds, are they?」
Harry:「Thanks, Hedwig,」
Harry:「Nearly six. How d’you reckon they’re coming? The train?」
