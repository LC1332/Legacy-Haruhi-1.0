Ginny:「A what? A what, exactly?」
Harry:「He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny —」
Ron:「Shut your mouth!」
Ginny:「No, I will not! I’ve seen you with Phlegm, hoping she’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her, it’s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself, you wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it!」
Harry:「You don’t know what you’re talking about!」
Ginny:「Harry’s snogged Cho Chang! And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and that’s because you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!」
Harry:「C’mon」
