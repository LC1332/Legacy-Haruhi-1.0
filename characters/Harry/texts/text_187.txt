Riddle:「LEAVE THE BIRD! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU! YOU CAN STILL SMELL HIM! KILL HIM!」
:Fawkes circling the basilisk's head, piping his eerie song, jabbing at its scaly nose
Harry:「Help me, help me, someone — anyone —」
:Harry grabbed the Sorting Hat, rammed it onto his head, threw himself flat onto the floor
:Harry grabbed the top of the hat, felt a gleaming silver sword beneath it
:Harry felt a searing pain above his elbow, a fang sinking into his arm, wrenched it out, watched his own blood soaking his robes
Harry:「Fawkes, You were fantastic, Fawkes. . . .」
:Harry felt drowsy, everything spinning, the Chamber coming back into focus
Harry:「Riddle was pointing Harry’s wand at Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in a whirl of gold and scarlet.」
Harry:「Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and something fell into Harry’s lap — the diary.」
