Fudge:「smiled at Harry over the rim of his teacup, rather like an uncle surveying a favorite nephew.」
Harry:「opened his mouth to speak, couldn’t think of anything to say, and closed it again.」
Fudge:「Ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle? Well, I won’t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.」
Harry:「I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays, and I don’t ever want to go back to Privet Drive.」
Harry:「Hang on, What about my punishment?」
Harry:「Last year, I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle’s house! The Ministry of Magic said I’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there!」
