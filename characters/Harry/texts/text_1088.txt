Hermione:「He’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught」
Harry:「We’ve been down to see him by night before」
Hermione:「We’ve risked a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all — Aragog’s dead. If it were a question of saving him —」
Ron:「You didn’t meet him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a lot」
Hermione:「Harry, you can’t be thinking of going. It’s such a pointless thing to get detention for」
Harry:「I s’pose Hagrid’ll have to bury Aragog without us」
Hermione:「Felix Felicis?」
Harry:「I dunno . . . I was sort of saving it. . . .」
Hermione:「Harry? Are you still with us?」
Harry:「Wha — ? Yeah, of course. Well . . . okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.」
