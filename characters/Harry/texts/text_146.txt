Professor McGonagall:「“This is out of my hands, Potter,”」
Harry:「“Professor, I swear I didn’t —”」
Professor McGonagall:「“Lemon drop!”」
Professor McGonagall:「told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.」
Harry:「looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers’ offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore’s was by far the most interesting. If he hadn’t been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.」
Harry:「“Er, yes,” Harry muttered. “Er — sorry to bother you — I wanted to ask —”」
Harry:「“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn’t move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.」
