Ron:「Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn’t going to tell you — anyway, Malfoy could’ve sent off for it since —」
Professor McGonagall:「That’s enough! Potter, I appreciate you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr. Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds of people — and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge — Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.」
:Ron muttered
Professor McGonagall:「How do you know, Professor? Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank you for telling me your suspicions, Potter, but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.」
