Hermione:「Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.」
Professor McGonagall:「Miss Granger!」
Hermione:「I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.」
Ron:「Hermione Granger, telling a downright lie to a teacher?」
Harry:「If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off when they arrived.」
Professor McGonagall:「Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?」
