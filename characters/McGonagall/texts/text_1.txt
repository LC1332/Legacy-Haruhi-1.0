Dumbledore:「You can’t blame them. We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.」
Professor McGonagall:「I know that. But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.」
Professor McGonagall:「A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?」
Dumbledore:「A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.」
Professor McGonagall:「No, thank you, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone —」
Professor McGonagall:「But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.」
