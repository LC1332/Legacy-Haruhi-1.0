Madam Rosmerta:「I did hear a rumor.」
Professor McGonagall:「Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?」
Madam Rosmerta:「Do you think Black’s still in the area, Minister?」
Fudge:「I’m sure of it.」
Madam Rosmerta:「You know that the dementors have searched my pub twice? Scared all my customers away. . . . It’s very bad for business, Minister.」
Fudge:「Rosmerta, m’dear, I don’t like them any more than you do, Necessary precaution . . . unfortunate, but there you are. . . . I’ve just met some of them. They’re in a fury against Dumbledore — he won’t let them inside the castle grounds.」
Professor McGonagall:「I should think not. How are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?」
