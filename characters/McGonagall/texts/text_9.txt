Wood:「Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?」
Professor McGonagall:「Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team. He’s just the build for a Seeker, too.」
Wood:「Light — speedy — we’ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.」
Professor McGonagall:「I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. . . .」
