Professor McGonagall:「You haven’t been given another detention!」
Harry:「No, Professor!」
Professor McGonagall:「Well then, why are you out of class?」
Professor Grubbly-Plank:「Injured owl, did you say?」
Harry:「Yes, she turned up after the other post owls and her wing’s all funny, look —」
Professor Grubbly-Plank:「Hmm, Looks like something’s attacked her. Can’t think what would have done it, though. . . . Thestrals will sometimes go for birds, of course, but Hagrid’s got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls . . .」
Harry:「Harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were, he just wanted to know that Hedwig was going to be all right.」
Professor McGonagall:「Do you know how far this owl’s traveled, Potter?」
