Umbridge:「I have not yet managed to find one, But it doesn’t matter if she won’t speak, I can take up the story from here. You will remember, Minister, that I sent you a report back in October that Potter had met a number of fellow students in the Hog’s Head in Hogsmeade —」
Professor McGonagall:「And what is your evidence for that?」
Umbridge:「I have testimony from Willy Widdershins, Minerva, who happened to be in the bar at the time. He was heavily bandaged, it is true, but his hearing was quite unimpaired, He heard every word Potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me —」
Professor McGonagall:「Oh, so that’s why he wasn’t prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets! What an interesting insight into our justice system!」
