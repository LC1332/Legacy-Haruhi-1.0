Harry:「Look, Professor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone —」
Professor McGonagall:「How do you know — ?」
Harry:「Professor, I think — I know — that someone’s going to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.」
Professor McGonagall:「Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow. I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.」
