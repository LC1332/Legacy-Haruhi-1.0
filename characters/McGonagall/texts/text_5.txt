Harry:「A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teacher’s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.」
ghosts:「Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance — My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here? New students! About to be Sorted, I suppose? Hope to see you in Hufflepuff! My old House, you know.」
sharp voice:「Move along now, The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.」
Professor McGonagall:「Now, form a line, and follow me.」
