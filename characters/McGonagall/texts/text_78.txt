Slughorn:「But will we have a single pupil after this? Parents will want to keep their children at home and I can’t say I blame them. Personally, I don’t think we’re in more danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else, but you can’t expect mothers to think like that. They’ll want to keep their families together, it’s only natural.」
Professor McGonagall:「And in any case, it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the school — and I must say that Professor Dumbledore’s murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of Slytherin’s monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle. . . .」
Professor Flitwick:「We must consult the governors. We must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be made hastily.」
Professor McGonagall:「What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?」
