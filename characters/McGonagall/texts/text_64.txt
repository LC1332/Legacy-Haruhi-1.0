Umbridge:「I was just wondering whether Mr. Potter has quite the temperament for an Auror?」
Professor McGonagall:「Were you? Well, Potter, if you are serious in this ambition, I would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your Transfiguration and Potions up to scratch. I see Professor Flitwick has graded you between ‘Acceptable’ and ‘Exceeds Expectations’ for the last two years, so your Charm work seems satisfactory; as for Defense Against the Dark Arts, your marks have been generally high, Professor Lupin in particular thought you — are you quite sure you wouldn’t like a cough drop, Dolores?」
Umbridge:「Oh, no need, thank you, Minerva, I was just concerned that you might not have Harry’s most recent Defense Against the Dark Arts marks in front of you. I’m quite sure I slipped in a note . . .」
Professor McGonagall:「What, this thing?」
Professor McGonagall:「Of course I understood it」
Umbridge:「I’m terribly sorry to have to contradict you, Minerva, but as you will see from my note, Harry has been achieving very poor results in his classes with me —」
Professor McGonagall:「I should have made my meaning plainer」
