Snape:「Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted.」
Professor McGonagall:「Sit, she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire. Explain, she said, her glasses glinting ominously.」
Ron:「Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through. — so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn’t get on the train.」
Professor McGonagall:「Why didn’t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl? Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.」
