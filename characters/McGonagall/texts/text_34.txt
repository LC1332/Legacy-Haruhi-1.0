Ron:「Scurvy cur.」
Sir Cadogan:「And the same to you, sir!」
:Harry collected the Firebolt and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his birthday, brought them downstairs, and tried to find something to do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it. He and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor McGonagall.
Professor McGonagall:「So that’s it, is it? Miss Granger has just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.」
Harry:「W-what? Why?」
Professor McGonagall:「It will need to be checked for jinxes. Of course, I’m no expert, but I daresay Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick will strip it down —」
Harry:「There’s nothing wrong with it! Honestly, Professor —」
Professor McGonagall:「You can’t know that, Potter, not until you’ve flown it, at any rate, and I’m afraid that is out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tampered with. I shall keep you informed.」
