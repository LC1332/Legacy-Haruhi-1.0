Leonard:「It's fine. You win.」
Howard:「What's his problem?」
Sheldon:「His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.」
Howard:「Been there.」
Raj:「''(Entering)'' Hello. Sorry I'm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.」
Howard:「Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?」
Raj:「Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee.」
Leonard:「What did she say? Is she still mad at me?」
Raj:「Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you and... then she hugged me.」
Howard:「She hugged you? How did she hug you? ''(Raj hugs Howard.)'' Is that her perfume I smell?」
Raj:「Intoxicating, isn't it?」
