Sheldon:「I don't know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.」
Leonard:「Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned.」
Sheldon:「The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the subterranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy.」
Howard:「Talk about your chick magnets.」
Raj:「Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I’ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your Speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!」
Sheldon:「Gentlemen, I know we said we'd take turns, but I think you'd agree that practicality dictates it remain here.」
Howard:「You can't just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, “you wanna come up and see my time machine, it’s at my friends house,” how lame is that?」
Raj:「He's got a point.」
Sheldon:「Alright, I think we’re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine.」
Leonard:「Seconded.」
Howard:「I was going to put down a towel.」
Raj:「I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis.」
Leonard:「That sounds fair.」
Sheldon:「Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month?」
Raj:「Twice a month.」
Sheldon:「Then no.」
Raj:「Okay, every other month.」
