Howard:「Sorry. ''(Crunching sound)'' Found ‘em.」
Leonard:「Oh great.」
Howard:「Sorry, don’t you have a spare.」
Leonard:「Yeah, at home.」
Raj:「Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston.」
Howard:「Unless Sheldon’s there, in which case you’ll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web.」
Leonard:「''(Dials phone)'' Hi, Penny. I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye. ''(To Howard)'' He’s home, I’m screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness.」
Raj:「How about Lasic?」
Leonard:「You want me to get eye surgery?」
Raj:「Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?」
