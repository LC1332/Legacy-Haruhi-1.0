Sheldon:「We might as well stop, it's a stalemate. You're beating me in tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.」
Raj:「Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here. ''(Strains to push Sheldon’s arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.)'' Okay, it's a stalemate.」
