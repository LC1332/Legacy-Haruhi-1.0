Sheldon:「Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausen's trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or it's ultimately circular, i.e., I'm moving out because I'm moving out.」
Leonard:「I'm still confused.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, I don't see how I could have made it any simpler.」
Howard:「''(Entering)'' Hey, qu’est q’was up?」
Raj:「We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.」
Howard:「And some of those skinless chicks were hot.」
Sheldon:「If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack.」
Howard:「That's kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia.」
Leonard:「It's not you, Howard, he says he's moving out.」
Raj:「What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?」
Leonard:「No.」
Raj:「Did you take a band aid off in front of him?」
Leonard:「No.」
Howard:「Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door?」
Raj:「Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often?」
Leonard:「No.」
Howard:「Did you make fun of trains?」
Leonard:「I didn't do anything, he's just gone insane.」
Raj:「Well, we all knew this day was coming.」
