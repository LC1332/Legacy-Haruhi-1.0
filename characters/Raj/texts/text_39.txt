Sheldon:「It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.」
Lalita:「Oh my.」
Raj:「Back off Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「What?」
Raj:「If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.」
Sheldon:「I'm not hitting on her.」
Lalita:「And I am not your lady.」
Howard:「And you have no wrath.」
Raj:「You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.」
Lalita:「Okay, let's get something straight here. The only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case, I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you.」
Sheldon:「Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom.」
Raj:「Oh, screw Princess Punchali.」
Lalita:「Hey, you can't talk to me like that.」
Raj:「But you're not Princess Punchali.」
