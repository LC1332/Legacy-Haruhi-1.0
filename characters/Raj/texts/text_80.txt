Howard:「Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.」
Sheldon:「Wait a minute, I'd want to see that too.」
Leonard:「So, when it's your turn you can.」
Sheldon:「But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell's lab is going to get very crowded, he'll know something's up.」
Raj:「Also, since the time machine doesn't move in space, you'll end up in 1876 Pasadena.」
Howard:「And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, “hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?”」
Raj:「Mrs Bell was deaf, she's not even going to hear you knock.」
Sheldon:「Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.」
Raj:「Ooh, how far into the future?」
Sheldon:「If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10, 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.」
Leonard:「Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10, 2328. Here we go into the future. ''(Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.)'' That was fun.」
Raj:「My turn.」
