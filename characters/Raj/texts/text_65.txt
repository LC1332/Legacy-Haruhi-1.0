'''Scene''':「''[[Apartment 4A]]. Howard is looking at his mobile phone.''」
Howard:「Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. There's going to be a scene depicting Spock's birth.」
Raj:「I'd be more interested in a scene depicting Spock's conception.」
Sheldon:「Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it's an extremely private matter.」
Leonard:「Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.」
Howard:「Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.」
Raj:「How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose.」
