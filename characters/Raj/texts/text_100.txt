Howard:「Stay frosty, there's a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth.」
Leonard:「Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands.」
Sheldon:「Lock and load.」
Howard:「Raj, blow up the gates.」
Raj:「Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!」
Howard:「Don't just stand there, slash and move, slash and move.」
Leonard:「Stay in formation.」
Howard:「Leonard, you've got one on your tail.」
Leonard:「That's alright, my tail's prehensile, I'll swat him off.」
Raj:「I’ve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!」
Leonard:「Raj, no, it's a trap, they're flanking us!」
Raj:「Oooh, he's got me.」
