Howard:「Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn't, would you want me to tell you?」
Sheldon:「That depends. When I learn that I'm a robot, will I be able to handle it?」
Howard:「Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your side.」
Sheldon:「Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that I'm a robot, would I be bound by Asimov's three laws of robotics?」
Raj:「You might be bound by them right now.」
