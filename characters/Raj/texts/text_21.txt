Leonard:「Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend. If you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.」
Sheldon:「Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food? She uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.」
Leonard:「We don't order egg rolls.」
Sheldon:「Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.」
Raj:「Can we please make a decision? Not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.」
Leonard:「Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.」
Sheldon:「No.」
Raj:「Uurgh.」
