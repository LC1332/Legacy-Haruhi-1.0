Leonard:「how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.」
Howard:「Yeah, that's why I did it.」
Leonard:「Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party.」
:「''(Opens door. Raj is drunkenly singing True Colors very badly into a microphone with his shirt off and a bandana round his head while waving a beer bottle. Penny and Sheldon are asleep on the couch and armchair respectively.)''」
Raj:「Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise!」
:「Time shift. View of a mobile phone video screen. Raj has a woman sitting on his shoulders.」
Raj:「Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don't know where you are dude, but it's really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh... ''(girl pours booze into his mouth)'' Oh look, there's a girl taking her shirt off.」
Penny:「That's my friend Carol. Remind me, I’ve got to introduce her to Howard.」
Raj:「Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.」
