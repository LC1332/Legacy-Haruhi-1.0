Sheldon:「I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?」
Leonard:「We’re socialising. Meeting new people.」
Sheldon:「Telepathically?」
Penny:「''(Crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen)'' Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!」
Raj:「Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.」
Leonard:「She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.」
Sheldon:「And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.」
Howard:「Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it's time for me to turn my head and cough.」
Raj:「What is your move?」
Howard:「I'm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she's thinking we’re in sync, we belong together.」
Leonard:「Where do you get this stuff?」
Howard:「You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there's this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls.」
Raj:「Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men.」
