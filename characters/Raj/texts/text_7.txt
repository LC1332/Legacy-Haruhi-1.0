'''Scene''':「''[[The Cheesecake Factory]]''」
Sheldon:「Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.」
Howard:「Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.」
Leonard:「No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.」
Raj:「Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.」
Penny:「Hi, you guys ready to order?」
Howard:「Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?」
Leonard:「And Orcs!」
Penny:「I'll be back.」
Raj:「Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.」
