Penny:「Oh, Raj, look at you!」
Raj:「I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?」
Penny:「Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early aren't you?」
Raj:「It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while you're getting ready.」
Penny:「Oh, I'm ready.」
Raj:「That's what you're wearing.」
Penny:「Um, yeah, why what's wrong with it?」
Raj:「Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous.」
Penny:「Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous you're gonna get.」
