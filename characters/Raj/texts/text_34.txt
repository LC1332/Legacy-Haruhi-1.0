'''Scene''':「''Apartment 4A''」
Sheldon:「''(On phone)'' This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well I'm sorry too, but there's just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you don't have dinosaurs. Well I'll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know you're texting about me, and I'd really like you to stop.」
Raj:「''(Entering)'' Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed.」
Leonard:「Hey, I thought you were finding new friends.」
Raj:「I’ve got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this.」
[[Lalita]]:「''(Voice from Raj’s phone)'' Hi Rajesh, this is Lalita Gupta. Your mother gave my mother your phone number to give to me. So I'm calling you, and, ah... call me back. Bye.」
Raj:「Can you believe how pushy she is?」
Leonard:「So don't call her.」
Raj:「If I don't call her, I won't hear the end of it from my parents.」
Leonard:「So call her.」
Raj:「How can I call her, you know I can't talk to women.」
Leonard:「I'm done, anybody else?」
Howard:「Give me the phone.」
Raj:「Why?」
Howard:「Just give it to me. ''(Dials)''」
Raj:「What are you doing?」
Howard:「Don't worry, you'll thank me. ''(In a fake Indian accent)'' Hello Lalita, Raj Koothrappali. ''(Raj starts to chase Howard across the room.)'' Yes it is good to talk to you too. So, what are you wearing. Oh, not important, so, anyhow, when would you like to meet. Friday works for me. And I call you with the time and place, but in the meantime, keep it real babe. ''(In own voice)'' You may now thank me.」
Raj:「For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character?」
Howard:「Fine, next time make your own date.」
Raj:「I didn't want to make this one.」
Leonard:「Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl.」
Raj:「Great, then we'll get married, I won't be able to talk to her, and we'll spend the rest of our lives in total silence.」
