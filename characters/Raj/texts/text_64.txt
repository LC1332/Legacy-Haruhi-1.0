'''Scene''':「''The park. The four guys are carrying remote control rockets.''」
Howard:「Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park.」
Leonard:「I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman “you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.”」
Raj:「Hey, look at that. ''(There is a group of youngsters on the grass, laying about. One is playing a guitar. Dennis Kim is among them. He is drinking something from a bottle in a brown paper bag.)'' It's Dennis Kim.」
Howard:「Wow, I almost didn't recognize him.」
Raj:「You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. ''(Dennis is now snogging the face off Emma)''」
