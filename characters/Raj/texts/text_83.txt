Howard:「Why?」
Leonard:「Just... personal reasons.」
Sheldon:「My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny.」
Leonard:「Look, do you want to buy me out or not?」
Raj:「I'll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.」
Howard:「Screw his balcony, I'll give you a hundred and twenty and we'll put it in my garage.」
Leonard:「I paid two hundred dollars for my share.」
Raj:「Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.」
Sheldon:「I'll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is.」
Raj:「Three hundred, and I'll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects.」
Leonard:「No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I'm getting rid of all of it.」
Howard:「You can't do that, look what you've created here, it's like nerdvana.」
Raj:「More importantly, you've a Darth Vader voice changer?」
Leonard:「Not for long.」
Raj:「Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.」
Howard:「Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.」
Raj:「Too bad, I called dibs.」
Howard:「Well you can't just call dibs.」
Raj:「I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.」
Sheldon:「Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.」
Leonard:「It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.」
Raj:「Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?」
Howard:「Will you forget dibs!」
Leonard:「He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.」
Sheldon:「What's the number, I'll match it.」
Raj:「I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees.」
Sheldon:「What's the exchange rate.」
Raj:「None of your business. Take it or leave it.」
Howard:「''(On phone)'' Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel.」
Leonard:「Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.」
Sheldon:「Who cares, as long as you pick me.」
Raj:「Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let's talk.」
