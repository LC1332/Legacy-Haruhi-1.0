'''Scene''':「The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door.」
Raj:「''(Entering dressed as Thor)'' Hey. Sorry I'm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.」
Leonard:「You went with Thor?」
Raj:「What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon ''(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines)'' is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect.」
Howard:「I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.」
Raj:「Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.」
