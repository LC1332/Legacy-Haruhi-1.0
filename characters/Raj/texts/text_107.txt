Leonard:「Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?」
Sheldon:「They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing.」
Howard:「You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box.」
Leonard:「What are you talking about, the date went fine.」
Raj:「Dude, she said she wants to slow things down.」
Leonard:「Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. It's like saying “I’m really enjoying this meal, I’m going to slow down and savour it.”」
Howard:「No, it's like “this fish tastes bad, so I’m going to slow down and spit it out.”」
Raj:「You being the fish.」
