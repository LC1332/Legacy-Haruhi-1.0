Leonard:「You know what, I'm happy that Penny's moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself.」
Howard:「Are you saying that you've been holding back?」
Leonard:「Of course. Out of respect.」
Howard:「So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?」
Raj:「Who were you respecting then?」
Leonard:「What? I’ve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle.」
Sheldon:「Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two.」
Leonard:「Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?」
Raj:「Doesn't count.」
Leonard:「Why not?」
Raj:「What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con.」
Howard:「You're only saying that because of what happened to you.」
Leonard:「What happened to you?」
Raj:「N-n-n-nothing happened to me.」
Howard:「It wasn't your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.」
Raj:「H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on.」
Leonard:「Yes I have, it's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.」
Howard:「Like who?」
Leonard:「Well, there's Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so it's a little geographically undesirable.」
Raj:「What about Leslie Winkle.」
Sheldon:「Oh no.」
Raj:「Why?」
Sheldon:「Her research methodology is sloppy, she's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse she's often mean to me.」
Raj:「I think she's smoking hot.」
Howard:「I'd hit that.」
Sheldon:「You'd hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.」
Leonard:「Look, I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.」
Howard:「Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.」
Raj:「Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.」
Howard:「You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?」
Raj:「I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it. ''(Leaving)'' And he told me his name was Kimberley!」
