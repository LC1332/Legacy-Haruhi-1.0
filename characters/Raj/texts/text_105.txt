Sheldon:「Well, no.」
Howard:「I smell robot.」
Leonard:「''(Entering)'' Hey, what's going on.」
Sheldon:「The internet's been down for half an hour.」
Raj:「Also, Sheldon may be a robot.」
Howard:「So, how did it go with Leslie?」
Leonard:「Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didn't move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway.」
Sheldon:「Oh, I’ve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I don't know if I can take it.」
Raj:「You could power down.」
