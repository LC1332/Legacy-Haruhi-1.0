Leonard:「Guys, let's remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my roommate.」
Howard:「So?」
Leonard:「So nothing, let's destroy him.」
Sheldon:「''(Walking past)'' Gentlemen.」
Raj:「Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!」
Howard:「Okay, we’re going to need a strong fourth for our team.」
Raj:「You know who's apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV's Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something.」
Leonard:「Raj, we’re not getting TV's Blossom to join our physics bowl team.」
Raj:「How about the girl from the Wonder Years?」
Howard:「Gentlemen, I believe I’ve found the solution to all our problems.」
Leonard:「We can't ask Leslie Winkle.」
Raj:「Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night's chutney?」
Leonard:「Yes.」
Howard:「Sometimes you've got to take one for the team.」
Raj:「Yeah. Sack up, dude.」
