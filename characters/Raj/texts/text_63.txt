Gablehouser:「Well, uh, well, uh....」
Leonard:「The kid got a girl.」
Raj:「Unbelievable.」
Howard:「Did anyone see how he did it?」
Sheldon:「''(To Gablehouser)'' Don't worry, I’ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honored daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you.」
Howard:「He's back.」
Leonard:「Yeah, mission accomplished.」
Raj:「Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?」
Howard:「I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy.」
Leonard:「Well, why do we go home alone every night, we’re still smart.」
Raj:「Maybe we’re too smart. So smart it's offputting.」
