Raj:「Welcome to the Raj Mahal.」
Penny:「Yes, it's very nice, goodnight Raj.」
Raj:「No, wait, the evening's not over.」
Penny:「Yes it is.」
Raj:「No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face.」
Penny:「Oh, wow, is the evening over.」
Raj:「Wait, wait, that's my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents.」
Penny:「Wait, meet them.」
Raj:「Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. I'm not drunk.」
[[Mrs. Koothrappali]]:「Why would you say that?」
Raj:「Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny.」
Penny:「I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.」
[[Dr. Koothrappali]]:「I can't see her, center her in the frame.」
Raj:「Here you go, cute huh?」
