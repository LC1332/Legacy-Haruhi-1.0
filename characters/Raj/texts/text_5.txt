'''Scene''':「''The stairwell. Raj is coming up the stairs, he meets Penny who is going down.''」
Penny:「Hey Raj. ''(Raj stands looking uncomfortable.)'' Hey, listen, I don't know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but I'm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?」
Raj:「''(Internally, while Penny continues to talk)'' Ooh, she's standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?」
Penny:「You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you don't shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?」
Raj:「''(Internally)'' She's so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl. We'd have the same cultural background, and my wife could sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me.」
Penny:「It's obvious that they meant well, but I'm just, I'm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and it's just freaking me out.」
Penny:「I mean, just because most of the men I’ve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesn't mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?」
Raj:「''(Internally)'' She asked me a question. I should probably nod. ''(Does.)''」
Penny:「That's exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. You're a doll. ''(She hugs him.)''」
Raj:「''(Internally)'' Oh-oh. Turn your pelvis. ''(Does.)''」
