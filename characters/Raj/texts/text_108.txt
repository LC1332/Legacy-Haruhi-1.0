Leonard:「Okay, alright, let's assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong.」
Howard:「Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what I'm getting into.」
Leonard:「I didn't say anything like that.」
Howard:「Good, ‘cos they don't work.」
Raj:「They also don't care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, that's my home run swing.」
Leonard:「Look, everything went fine. I didn't even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me.」
Howard:「Let's go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest.」
Raj:「Nice close up, by the way.」
Sheldon:「Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans.」
Leonard:「That's not a bad sign.」
Sheldon:「Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.」
Raj:「And the worst sign of all is, you're here and not there.」
Leonard:「I'm not there because I'm taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera.」
Raj:「He was a lot more fun when he had no hope.」
