Riddle:「Was my father a wizard? He was called Tom Riddle too, they’ve told me.」
Dumbledore:「I’m afraid I don’t know.」
Riddle:「My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died. It must’ve been him. So — when I’ve got all my stuff — when do I come to this Hogwarts?」
Dumbledore:「All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope. You will leave from King’s Cross Station on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.」
Dumbledore:「Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.」
Dumbledore:「No, I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him, something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others’ sake as much as his.」
