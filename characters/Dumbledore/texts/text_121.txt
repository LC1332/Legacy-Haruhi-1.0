Harry:「No, he can stay with Hagrid. I think Buckbeak would prefer that.」
Dumbledore:「Hagrid will be delighted. He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in the interests of Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’ for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now, Harry, is your trunk packed?」
Harry:「Erm . . .」
Dumbledore:「Doubtful that I would turn up?」
Dumbledore:「Just one last thing, then.」
Uncle Vernon:「Preposterous.」
Dumbledore:「Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country. The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his parents’ murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own.」
