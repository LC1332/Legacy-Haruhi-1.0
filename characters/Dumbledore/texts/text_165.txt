Dumbledore:「I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn. When you have that last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both of us.」
Harry:「Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir? He didn’t say. . . .」
Dumbledore:「Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job. The aftermath of our little meeting proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort.」
