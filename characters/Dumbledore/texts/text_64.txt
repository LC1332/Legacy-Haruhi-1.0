Harry:「Bertha? Is that — was that Bertha Jorkins?」
Dumbledore:「Yes, that was Bertha as I remember her at school.」
Dumbledore:「So, Harry, before you got lost in my thoughts, you wanted to tell me something.」
Harry:「Voldemort got a letter from an owl. He said something like, Wormtail’s blunder had been repaired. He said someone was dead. Then he said, Wormtail wouldn’t be fed to the snake — there was a snake beside his chair. He said — he said he’d be feeding me to it, instead. Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Wormtail — and my scar hurt. It woke me up, it hurt so badly.」
Dumbledore:「I see. Now, has your scar hurt at any other time this year, excepting the time it woke you up over the summer?」
Dumbledore:「D’you — d’you know why my scar’s hurting me?」
Dumbledore:「Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed. That is no ordinary scar.」
