Harry:「Because you gave it to her. In Flourish and Blotts. You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it, didn’t you?」
:Lucius Malfoy saw his right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand
Dumbledore:「Oh, no one will be able to do that. Not now that Riddle has vanished from the book. On the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, not to go giving out any more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things. If any more of them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, for one, will make sure they are traced back to you. . . .」
:Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment
Harry:「Professor Dumbledore, Can I give that diary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?」
Dumbledore:「Certainly, Harry. But hurry. The feast, remember. . . .」
