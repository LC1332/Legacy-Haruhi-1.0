Harry:「Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party . . . well, I followed them, actually. . . .」
Dumbledore:「Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great importance.」
Harry:「Not of great importance? Professor, did you understand — ?」
Dumbledore:「Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I understood everything you told me. I think you might even consider the possibility that I understood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have confided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet.」

Dumbledore:「And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more important things to discuss with you this evening.」
