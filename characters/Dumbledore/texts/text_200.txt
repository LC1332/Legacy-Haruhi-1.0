Snape:「And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try his strength. Meanwhile, the connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort."
Dumbledore:「You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?」
Snape:「Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?」
Snape:「Lately, only those whom I could not save.」
Snape:「You have used me.」
Dumbledore:「Meaning?」
Snape:「For him? Expecto Patronum!」
Dumbledore:「After all this time?」
