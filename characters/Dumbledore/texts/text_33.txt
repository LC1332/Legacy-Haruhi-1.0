Fudge:「The Daily Prophet’s going to have a field day! We had Black cornered and he slipped through our fingers yet again! All it needs now is for the story of that hippogriff’s escape to get out, and I’ll be a laughingstock! Well . . . I’d better go and notify the Ministry. . . .」
Dumbledore:「And the dementors? They’ll be removed from the school, I trust?」
