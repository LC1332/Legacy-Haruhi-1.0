Professor McGonagall:「A letter? Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!」
Dumbledore:「Exactly. It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?」
Professor McGonagall:「Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?」
Dumbledore:「Hagrid’s bringing him.」
Professor McGonagall:「I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place, but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?」
Dumbledore:「Hagrid.」
Dumbledore:「No problems, were there?」
Professor McGonagall:「Is that where — ?」
Dumbledore:「Yes. He’ll have that scar forever.」
