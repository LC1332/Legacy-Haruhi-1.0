Winky:「Noooo! Master Barty, Master Barty, what is you saying?」
Dumbledore:「You killed your father. What did you do with the body?」
Narrator:Barty Crouch think "Carried it into the forest. Covered it with the Invisibility Cloak. I had the map with me. I watched Potter run into the castle. He met Snape. Dumbledore joined them. I watched Potter bringing Dumbledore out of the castle. I walked back out of the forest, doubled around behind them, went to meet them. I told Dumbledore Snape had told me where to come. Dumbledore told me to go and look for my father. I went back to my father’s body. Watched the map. When everyone was gone, I Transfigured my father’s body. He became a bone . . . I buried it, while wearing the Invisibility Cloak, in the freshly dug earth in front of Hagrid’s cabin. I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner. Turned it into a Portkey. My master’s plan worked. He is returned to power and I will be honored by him beyond the dreams of wizards."
Winky:「continued sobs」
Dumbledore:「And tonight . . .」
