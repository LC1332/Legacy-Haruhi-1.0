Percy:「Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.」
Narrator:Professor Dumbledore think "Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you."
Dumbledore:「First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.」
Dumbledore:「I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.」
Harry:「He’s not serious?」
Harry:「Must be.」
Percy:「It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.」
Dumbledore:「And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!」
