I saw it happen . . .” He took a deep breath, “Ron’s dad — Mr. Weasley — has been attacked by a giant snake.”」

Dumbledore:「“How did you see this?” Dumbledore asked quietly, still not looking at Harry.」
Harry:「“Well . . . I don’t know,” said Harry, rather angrily — what did it matter? “Inside my head, I suppose —”」
Dumbledore:「“You misunderstand me,” said Dumbledore, still in the same calm tone. “I mean . . . can you remember — er — where you were positioned as you watched this attack happen? Were you perhaps standing beside the victim, or else looking down on the scene from above?”」
Dumbledore:「Is Arthur seriously injured?」
