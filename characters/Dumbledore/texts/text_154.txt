Slughorn:「I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t tell you if I did! Now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you mentioning them again!」
Dumbledore:「That’s all there is? Time to go.」
Harry:「That’s all there is?」
Dumbledore:「As you might have noticed, that memory has been tampered with.」
Harry:「But why would he do that?」
Dumbledore:「Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers, He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations. And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all.」
