The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such creations. The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of Godric’s Hollow."
