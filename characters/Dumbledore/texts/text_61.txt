Moody:「“Crouch is going to let him out,” Moody breathed quietly to Dumbledore. “He’s done a deal with him. Took me six months to track him down, and Crouch is going to let him go if he’s got enough new names. Let’s hear his information, I say, and throw him straight back to the dementors.”」
Dumbledore:「Dumbledore made a small noise of dissent through his long, crooked nose.」
Moody:「“Ah, I was forgetting . . . you don’t like the dementors, do you, Albus?” said Moody with a sardonic smile.」
Dumbledore:「“No,” said Dumbledore calmly, “I’m afraid I don’t. I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.”」
