Voldemort:「Yes, I’m very well. . . .」
Hepzibah:「I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose —」
Hepzibah:「Here, Hokey, take these away and lock them up again. . . . The usual enchantments . . .」
Dumbledore:「Time to leave, Harry.」
Dumbledore:「Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene, Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistress’s evening cocoa by accident.」
Harry:「Hokey confessed?」
Dumbledore:「She remembered putting something in her mistress’s cocoa that turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison, it was concluded that she had not meant to do it, but being old and confused —」
Harry:「— because she was a house-elf.」
Dumbledore:「She was old, she admitted to having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost over — but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.」
