Dumbledore:「“— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,” said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck.」
Dumbledore:「Dumbledore was striding serenely across the room wearing long midnight-blue robes and a perfectly calm expression.」
Dumbledore:「“I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.”」
