Winky:「Say no more, Master Barty, say no more, you is getting your father into trouble!」
Narrator:Mr. Crouch think "The dementors are blind. They sensed one healthy, one dying person entering Azkaban. They sensed one healthy, one dying person leaving it. My father smuggled me out, disguised as my mother, in case any prisoners were watching through their doors. My mother died a short while afterward in Azkaban. She was careful to drink Polyjuice Potion until the end. She was buried under my name and bearing my appearance. Everyone believed her to be me."
Dumbledore:「And what did your father do with you, when he had got you home?」
Narrator:Mr. Crouch think "Staged my mother’s death. A quiet, private funeral. That grave is empty. The house-elf nursed me back to health. Then I had to be concealed. I had to be controlled. My father had to use a number of spells to subdue me. When I had recovered my strength, I thought only of finding my master . . . of returning to his service."
Dumbledore:「How did your father subdue you?」
Dumbledore:「Did anybody ever discover that you were still alive? Did anyone know except your father and the house-elf?」
