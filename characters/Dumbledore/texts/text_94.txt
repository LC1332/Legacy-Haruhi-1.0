:Harry watching the portraits
wizard called Everard:「“Dumbledore!”」
Dumbledore:「“What news?”」
wizard called Everard:「“I yelled until someone came running, said I’d heard something moving downstairs — they weren’t sure whether to believe me but went down to check — you know there are no portraits down there to watch from. Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later. He doesn’t look good, he’s covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg’s portrait to get a good view as they left —”」
Dumbledore:「“Good,”」
silver-ringletted witch:「“Yes, they’ve taken him to St. Mungo’s, Dumbledore. . . . They carried him past under my portrait. . . . He looks bad . . .”」
Dumbledore:「“Thank you,”」
Professor McGonagall:「“And Dumbledore — what about Molly?”」
Dumbledore:「“That will be a job for Fawkes when he has finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching,”」
