Lucius Malfoy:「So! You’ve come back. The governors suspended you, but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.」
Dumbledore:「Well, you see, Lucius, the other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like being caught in a hailstorm of owls, to tell the truth. They’d heard that Arthur Weasley’s daughter had been killed and wanted me back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the job after all. Very strange tales they told me, too. . . . Several of them seemed to think that you had threatened to curse their families if they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.」
Lucius Malfoy:「So — have you stopped the attacks yet? Have you caught the culprit?」
Dumbledore:「We have.」
:Dumbledore held up the small black book with the large hole through the center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely
Lucius Malfoy:「I see . . .」
Dumbledore:「A clever plan. Because if Harry here and his friend Ron hadn’t discovered this book, why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn’t acted of her own free will. . . .」
