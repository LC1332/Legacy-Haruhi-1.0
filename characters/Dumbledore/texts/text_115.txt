Harry:「SO SIRIUS DESERVED WHAT HE GOT, DID HE?」
Dumbledore:「I did not say that, nor will you ever hear me say it, Sirius was not a cruel man, he was kind to house-elves in general. He had no love for Kreacher, because Kreacher was a living reminder of the home Sirius had hated.」
Harry:「Yeah, he did hate it!」
Harry:「You made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it, that’s why he wanted to get out last night —」
Dumbledore:「I was trying to keep Sirius alive」
Harry:「Wait」
Dumbledore:「You sent that Howler. You told her to remember — it was your voice —」
