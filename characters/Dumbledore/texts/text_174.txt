Harry:「“Come . . . with you . . . ?”」
Dumbledore:「“Only if you wish it, of course.”」
Harry:「“If I . . .”」
Harry:「And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to Dumbledore’s office in the first place. “You’ve found one? You’ve found a Horcrux?”」
Dumbledore:「“I believe so.”」
Harry:「“I’m not scared!” said Harry at once, and it was perfectly true; fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. “Which Horcrux is it? Where is it?”」
Dumbledore:「“I am not sure which it is — though I think we can rule out the snake — but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?”」
