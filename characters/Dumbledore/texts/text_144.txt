Riddle:「You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re from, isn’t it? ‘Professor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m not going, see? That old cat’s the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they’ll tell you!」
Dumbledore:「I am not from the asylum. I am a teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hogwarts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, nobody will force you —」
Riddle:「I’d like to see them try.」
Dumbledore:「Hogwarts is a school for people with special abilities —」
Riddle:「Magic?」
Dumbledore:「That’s right.」
Riddle:「All sorts. I can make things move without touching them. I can make animals do what I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want to.」
Narrator:Riddle think "I knew I was different. I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something."
Dumbledore:「Well, you were quite right. You are a wizard.」
