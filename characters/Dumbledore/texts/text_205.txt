Harry:「What’ve you done to him?」
Dumbledore:「Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it. They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?」
