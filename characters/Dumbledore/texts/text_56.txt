Dumbledore:「Good afternoon.」
Hermione:「We — er — we wanted to see Hagrid.」
Dumbledore:「Why don’t you come in?」
Hagrid:「’Lo.」

Dumbledore:「Living proof of what I’ve been telling you, Hagrid.」
Dumbledore:「Not a week has passed since I became headmaster of this school when I haven’t had at least one owl complaining about the way I run it. But what should I do? Barricade myself in my study and refuse to talk to anybody?」
