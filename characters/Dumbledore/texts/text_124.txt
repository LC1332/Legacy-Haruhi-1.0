Harry:「Oho!」
Dumbledore:「This is Harry Potter. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace Slughorn.」
Slughorn:「So that’s how you thought you’d persuade me, is it? Well, the answer’s no, Albus.」
:Slughorn pushed past Harry, face turned resolutely away
Dumbledore:「I suppose we can have a drink, at least? For old time’s sake?」
Slughorn:「Not so well. Weak chest. Wheezy. Rheumatism too. Can’t move like I used to.」
Dumbledore:「And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice. You can’t have had more than three minutes’ warning?」
Narrator:Harry think "He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady."
Dumbledore:「You’re not yet as old as I am, Horace.」
