Fudge:「Now see here, Dumbledore! You haven’t got authorization for that Portkey! You can’t do things like that right in front of the Minister of Magic, you — you —」
Dumbledore:「You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts. You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work. I will give you . . . half an hour of my time tonight, in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here. After that, I shall need to return to my school. If you need more help from me you are, of course, more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts. Letters addressed to the headmaster will find me.」
Fudge:「I — you —」
Dumbledore:「Take this Portkey, Harry.」
