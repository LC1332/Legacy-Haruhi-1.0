Harry:「Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was having my Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very — very strange.」
Dumbledore:「Indeed? said Dumbledore. Er — stranger than usual, you mean?」
Harry:「Yes . . . her voice went all deep and her eyes rolled and she said . . . she said Voldemort’s servant was going to set out to return to him before midnight. . . . She said the servant would help him come back to power. Harry stared up at Dumbledore. And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn’t remember anything she’d said. Was it — was she making a real prediction?」
Dumbledore:「Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been, he said thoughtfully. Who’d have thought it? That brings her total of real predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise. . . .」
Dumbledore:「It does not. Hasn’t your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed. . . . Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that. . . . You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.」
