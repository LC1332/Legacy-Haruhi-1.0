Harry:「And what are we doing here?」
Dumbledore:「Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you. Well, I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts.」
Harry:「How can I help with that, sir?」
Dumbledore:「Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you. Left here, Harry.」
Dumbledore:「I don’t think so.」
Horace:「There was no need to stick the wand in that hard. It hurt.」
Horace:「What gave it away? My dear Horace, if the Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have been set over the house.」
Dumbledore:「The Dark Mark. Knew there was something . . . ah well. Wouldn’t have had time anyway, I’d only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.」
Dumbledore:「What kind of blood was that, incidentally?」
