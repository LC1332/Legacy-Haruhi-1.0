Harry:「If their lessons were so very important, why had there been such a long gap between the first and second?」
Dumbledore:「You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord Voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle, Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord Voldemort.」
Dumbledore:「How do you know she was in London, sir?」
Dumbledore:「Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke, who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.」
:Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory
Harry:「He only gave her ten Galleons?」
Dumbledore:「Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity.」
