Malfoy:「You don’t know what I’m capable of, You don’t know what I’ve done!」
Dumbledore:「You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increasing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they have been feeble attempts. . . . So feeble, to be honest, that I wonder whether your heart has been really in it.」
Malfoy:「It has been in it! I’ve been working on it all year, and tonight —」
Dumbledore:「But you were saying . . . yes, you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my school, which, I admit, I thought impossible. . . . How did you do it?」
Malfoy:「I’m not afraid! It’s you who should be scared!」
Dumbledore:「But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not nearly as easy as the innocent believe. . . . So tell me, while we wait for your friends . . . how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.」
