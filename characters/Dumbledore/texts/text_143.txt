Mrs. Cole:「He’s a funny boy.」
Dumbledore:「Yes, I thought he might be.」
Mrs. Cole:「He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And then, when he got a little older, he was . . . odd.」
Dumbledore:「Odd in what way?」
Dumbledore:「Definitely.」
Mrs. Cole:「You’ll be taking him away, whatever?」
Dumbledore:「Whatever.」
Mrs. Cole:「I think he must be, but it’s very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty things . . .」
Dumbledore:「But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then」
Dumbledore:「You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be keeping him permanently?」
Dumbledore:「Very much.」
