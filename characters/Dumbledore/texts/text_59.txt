Moody:「And what do you think’s happened to Barty Crouch, Minister?」
Cornelius Fudge:「I see two possibilities, Alastor. Either Crouch has finally cracked — more than likely, I’m sure you’ll agree, given his personal history — lost his mind, and gone wandering off somewhere —」
Dumbledore:「He wandered extremely quickly, if that is the case, Cornelius.」
Fudge:「Or else — well . . .」
Fudge:「Well, I’ll reserve judgment until after I’ve seen the place where he was found, but you say it was just past the Beauxbatons carriage? Dumbledore, you know what that woman is?」
Dumbledore:「I consider her to be a very able headmistress — and an excellent dancer.」
