Harry:「Let me out,」
Dumbledore:「No,」
Harry:「Let me out,」
Dumbledore:「Not until I have had my say,」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "It is my fault that Sirius died, Or I should say almost entirely my fault — I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole. Sirius was a brave, clever, and energetic man, and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger. Nevertheless, you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight. If I had been open with you, Harry, as I should have been, you would have known a long time ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries, and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight. And Sirius would not have had to come after you. That blame lies with me, and with me alone."
Dumbledore:「Yes, Phineas,」
