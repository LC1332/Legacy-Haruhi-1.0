Harry:「Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you’ve told me?」
Dumbledore:「Yes, I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort’s secrets.」
Harry:「No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione. Good night.」
Harry:「Sir, that ring — You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night.」
Dumbledore:「The very same.」
Harry:「That would be around the time you injured your hand, then, sir?」
Dumbledore:「Around that time, yes, Harry.」
