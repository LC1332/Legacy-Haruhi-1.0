Dumbledore:「I think so. Are you sure you wouldn’t like to stay at Hogwarts tonight, Barty?」

Dumbledore:「You’ll come and have a drink before you go, at least?」
Dumbledore:「Professor Karkaroff — Madame Maxime — a nightcap?」
Dumbledore:「Harry, Cedric, I suggest you go up to bed. I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you, and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise.」
