Voldemort:「Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than here, at Hogwarts? Will you let me return? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.」
Dumbledore:「And what will become of those whom you command? What will happen to those who call themselves — or so rumor has it — the Death Eaters?」
Voldemort:「My friends will carry on without me, I am sure.」
Dumbledore:「I am glad to hear that you consider them friends. I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants.」
Dumbledore:「Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen. Now, Tom . . .」
Dumbledore:「Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen. What is it you’re after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?」
Voldemort:「This is your final word?」
Dumbledore:「It is.」
Voldemort:「This is your final word?」
Dumbledore:「It is.」
