Umbridge:「That’s all very fine, Headmaster. But we are now nearly six months on from the introduction of Educational Decree Number Twenty-four. If the first meeting was not illegal, all those that have happened since most certainly are.」
Dumbledore:「they certainly would be, if they had continued after the decree came into effect. Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued?」
:Kingsley whispered something
Narrator:Harry think "As Dumbledore spoke, Harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought Kingsley whispered something. He could have sworn too that he felt something brush against his side, a gentle something like a draft or bird wings, but looking down he saw nothing there."
Umbridge:「Evidence? Have you not been listening, Dumbledore? Why do you think Miss Edgecombe is here?」
Dumbledore:「Oh, can she tell us about six months’ worth of meetings? I was under the impression that she was merely reporting a meeting tonight.」
