Harry:「Bye.」
Dumbledore:「We do not want to be encumbered by these just now. I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak . . . just in case.」
:Harry extracted his Cloak from his trunk
Dumbledore:「And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.」
Harry:「But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?」
Dumbledore:「If there is an attack, I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. However, I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.」
Dumbledore:「You have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test.」
Harry:「Very good. Well, here we go.」
Harry:「Are you all right?」
Dumbledore:「The sensation does take some getting used to.」
Dumbledore:「So tell me, Harry. Your scar . . . has it been hurting at all?」
Harry:「Well, I’m not complaining.」
Harry:「Professor?」
Dumbledore:「Harry?」
