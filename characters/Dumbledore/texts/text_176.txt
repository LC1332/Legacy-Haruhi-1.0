Harry:「“Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!”」
Dumbledore:「Please let me finish.」
Harry:「He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven’t you noticed, Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?」
Harry:「But he’s a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir? And isn’t Voldemort convinced that Snape’s on his side, even now? Professor . . . how can you be sure Snape’s on our side?」
Dumbledore:「I am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.」

Harry:「I didn’t —」
Dumbledore:「I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.」
Dumbledore:「Very well, then: Listen. I take you with me on one condition: that you obey any command I might give you at once, and without question.」
Harry:「I — yes, of course.」
Dumbledore:「If I tell you to hide, you will do so?」
