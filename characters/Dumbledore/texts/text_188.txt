Madam Rosmerta:「I’ve got a couple behind the bar, Shall I run and fetch — ?」
:Harry spell to Rosmerta
Dumbledore:「Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry. It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . . Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.」
Harry:「What does it mean? Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been — Professor?」
Dumbledore:「Go and wake Severus. Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do nothing else, speak to nobody else, and do not remove your Cloak. I shall wait here.」
Malfoy:「Who else is here? A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?」
Harry:「No, I’ve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.」
Dumbledore:「Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?」
Malfoy:「They met some of your guards. They’re having a fight down below. They won’t be long. . . . I came on ahead. I — I’ve got a job to do.」
Dumbledore:「Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy.」
