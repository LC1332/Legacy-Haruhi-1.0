Harry:「So, the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?」
Dumbledore:「An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes.」
Harry:「So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you’ve been going when you’ve been leaving the school?」
Dumbledore:「Correct. I have been looking for a very long time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding another one. There are hopeful signs.」
Harry:「I can?」
Dumbledore:「Oh yes, I think you have earned that right.」
Dumbledore:「A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do. Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.」
