Bill:「Leave it to me.」
Dumbledore:「Minerva, I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible. Also — if she will consent to come — Madame Maxime.」
Dumbledore:「Poppy, would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moody’s office, where I think you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress? Do what you can for her, and take her back to the kitchens. I think Dobby will look after her for us.」
Ron:「Mum, shut up! It’s okay!」
Snape:「Him! What is he doing here?」
Dumbledore:「He is here at my invitation, as are you, Severus. I trust you both. It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other.」
Dumbledore:「That will do to be going on with. Now I have work for each of you. Fudge’s attitude, though not unexpected, changes everything. Sirius, I need you to set off at once. You are to alert Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, Mundungus Fletcher — the old crowd. Lie low at Lupin’s for a while; I will contact you there.」
