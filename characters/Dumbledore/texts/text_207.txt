Harry:「I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?」
Dumbledore:「That is up to you.」
Harry:「I’ve got a choice?」
Dumbledore:「Oh yes. We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.」
Harry:「Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.」
Dumbledore:「True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.」
Harry:「Tell me one last thing. Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?」
Dumbledore:「Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?」
