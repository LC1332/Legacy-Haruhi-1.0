Harry:「Sir, no, don’t touch — !」
Dumbledore:「I cannot touch. See? I cannot approach any nearer than this. You try.」
Harry:「Out of the way, please, Harry.」
Dumbledore:「You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?」
Dumbledore:「“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”」
Harry:「Was this more of Dumbledore’s insane determination to see good in everyone?」

Dumbledore:「“He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.”」
Harry:「“But what if — ?”」
Dumbledore:「“You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?”」
Dumbledore:「“Well, then, you have my orders.”」
Harry:「“I — all right, but —”」
Dumbledore:「“Your word, Harry.”」
