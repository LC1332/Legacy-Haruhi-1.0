Sirius:「No spell can reawaken the dead. All that would have happened is a kind of reverse echo. A shadow of the living Cedric would have emerged from the wand . . . am I correct, Harry?」
Dumbledore:「He spoke to me. The . . . the ghost Cedric, or whatever he was, spoke.」
Harry:「An echo, which retained Cedric’s appearance and character. I am guessing other such forms appeared . . . less recent victims of Voldemort’s wand. . . .」
Harry:「An old man, Bertha Jorkins. And . . .」
Dumbledore:「Your parents?」
:Harry Harry found he could not continue. He looked around at Sirius and saw that he had his face in his hands.
Dumbledore:「I will say it again, You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight, Harry. You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers. You have shouldered a grown wizard’s burden and found yourself equal to it — and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect. You will come with me to the hospital wing. I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight. A Sleeping Potion, and some peace . . . Sirius, would you like to stay with him?」
