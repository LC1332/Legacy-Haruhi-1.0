Harry:「What went wrong? Why did the love potion stop working?」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "Again, this is guesswork, but I believe that Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby’s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her, never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of his son."
Dumbledore:「I think that will do for tonight, Harry.」
Harry:「Yes, sir.」
Harry:「Sir . . . is it important to know all this about Voldemort’s past?」
Dumbledore:「Very important, I think.」
