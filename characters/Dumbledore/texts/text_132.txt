Harry:「“Good evening, sir,” said Harry, walking into the headmaster’s office.」
Dumbledore:「Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,」
Harry:「Yes, thanks, sir,」
Dumbledore:「You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!」
Harry:「Right,」
Harry:「I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead.」
Dumbledore:「who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snape’s detention, and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did; the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puffing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnificent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watching Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.」
Dumbledore:「Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for you to be given certain information.」
