You need your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.」
Harry:「said nothing」
Dumbledore:「On a different, though related, subject, it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.」
Harry:「What will you be teaching me, sir?」
Dumbledore:「Oh, a little of this, a little of that.」
