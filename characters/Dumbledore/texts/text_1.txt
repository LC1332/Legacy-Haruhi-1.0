Professor McGonagall:「surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.」
Dumbledore:「It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.」
Professor McGonagall:「But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.」
Dumbledore:「Voldemort had powers I will never have.」
