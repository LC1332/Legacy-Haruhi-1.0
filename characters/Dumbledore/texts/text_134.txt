Harry:「What happened to the girl in the cottage? Merope, or whatever her name was?」
Dumbledore:「Oh, she survived.」
Dumbledore:「Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight, but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot. Morfin, who already had a record of Muggle attacks, was sentenced to three years in Azkaban. Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition to Ogden, received six months.」
Dumbledore:「That old man was — ?」
Dumbledore:「It does. And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemort’s father. I wonder whether you noticed?」
