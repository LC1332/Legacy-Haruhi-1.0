Harry:「But I didn’t. I didn’t practice, I didn’t bother, I could’ve stopped myself having those dreams, Hermione kept telling me to do it, if I had he’d never have been able to show me where to go, and — Sirius wouldn’t — Sirius wouldn’t —」
Dumbledore:「Kreacher lied, You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.」
Harry:「He — he sent me on purpose?」
Dumbledore:「Kreacher has been serving more than one master for months. Kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before Christmas, when Sirius shouted at him to ‘get out.’ He took Sirius at his word and interpreted this as an order to leave the house. He went to Narcissa, sister of Bellatrix and wife of Lucius Malfoy.」
