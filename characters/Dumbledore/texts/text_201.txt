Harry:「But you’re dead.」
Dumbledore:「Oh yes.」
Harry:「Then . . . I’m dead too?」
Dumbledore:「That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.」
Dumbledore:「Explain.」
Harry:「So the part of his soul that was in me . . .」
Dumbledore:「Oh yes! Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your own, Harry.」
Harry:「But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse, and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?」
Dumbledore:「I think you know. Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.」
Harry:「I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same thing?」
Harry:「Are you sure we can’t do anything?」
Dumbledore:「There is no help possible.」
