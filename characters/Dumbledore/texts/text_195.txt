Malfoy:「I didn’t, I didn’t know he was going to come —」
Greyback:「I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Not when there are throats to be ripped out . . . Delicious, delicious . . .」
Greyback:「I could do you for afters, Dumbledore.」
fourth Death Eater:「We’ve got orders. Draco’s got to do it. Now, Draco, and quickly.」
