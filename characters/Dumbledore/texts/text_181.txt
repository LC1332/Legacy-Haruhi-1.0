Harry:「Professor? Do you think the Horcrux is here?」
Dumbledore:「Oh yes, Yes, I’m sure it is. The question is, how do we get to it?」
Harry:「We couldn’t . . . we couldn’t just try a Summoning Charm?」
:Harry keen on getting out of this place as soon as possible
Dumbledore:「Certainly we could, Why don’t you do it?」
:Harry something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away
:Harry vanished again with a crashing splash that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface
:Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall
Harry:「What was that?」
Dumbledore:「Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux.」
Dumbledore:「I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea, Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.」
Dumbledore:「What the things are, you mean, I doubt very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?」
