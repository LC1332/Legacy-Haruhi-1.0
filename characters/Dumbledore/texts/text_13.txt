McGonagall:「I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn’t hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.」
Dumbledore:「Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.」
Filch:「My cat has been Petrified! I want to see some punishment!」
Dumbledore:「We will be able to cure her, Argus. Professor Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.」
Dumbledore:「You may go.」
