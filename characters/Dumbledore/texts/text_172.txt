Harry:「So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?」
Dumbledore:「Yes, I think so. Without his Horcruxes, Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes.」
Harry:「But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power.」
Dumbledore:「Yes, you have. You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can —」
Harry:「So, when the prophecy says that I’ll have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not,’ it just means — love?」
Dumbledore:「Yes — just love. But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!」
