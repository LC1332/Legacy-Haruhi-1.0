Fred:「Harry — what’s going on? Professor McGonagall says you saw Dad hurt —」
Dumbledore:「Your father has been injured in the course of his work for the Order of the Phoenix. He has been taken to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I am sending you back to Sirius’s house, which is much more convenient for the hospital than the Burrow. You will meet your mother there.」
George:「How’re we going? Floo powder?」
Dumbledore:「Floo powder is not safe at the moment, the Network is being watched. You will be taking a Portkey. We are just waiting for Phineas Nigellus to report back. . . . I wish to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you —」
Dumbledore:「Come here, then. And quickly, before anyone else joins us . . .」
Dumbledore:「Good. On the count of three then . . . one . . . two . . .」
