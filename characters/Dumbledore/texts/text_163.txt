Voldemort:「I see it still. I merely wondered why you — who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister —」
Dumbledore:「Three times at the last count, actually. But the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we have in common, I think.」
Voldemort:「I have returned, later, perhaps, than Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, nevertheless, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have. I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard.」
Dumbledore:「Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us. Rumors of your doings have reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of them.」
Voldemort:「Certainly. I have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further, perhaps, than they have ever been pushed —」
Dumbledore:「Of some kinds of magic. Of some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully ignorant.」
