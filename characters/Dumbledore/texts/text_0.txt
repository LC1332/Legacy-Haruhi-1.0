Professor McGonagall:「Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right. You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news. I heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.」
Dumbledore:「You can’t blame them. We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.」
Professor McGonagall:「I know that. But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.」
Professor McGonagall:「A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?」
Dumbledore:「It certainly seems so. We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?」
