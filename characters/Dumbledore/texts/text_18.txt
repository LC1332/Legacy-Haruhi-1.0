Hagrid:「I never, You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir —」
Dumbledore:「I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence」
Fudge:「Look, Albus, Hagrid’s record’s against him. Ministry’s got to do something — the school governors have been in touch —」
Dumbledore:「Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before.」
