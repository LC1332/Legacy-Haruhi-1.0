Phineas Nigellus:「And what brings you here in the early hours of the morning? This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster. Or has Dumbledore sent you here? Oh, don’t tell me . . . Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson?」
Corpulent Wizard:「I hope this means that Dumbledore will soon be back with us? It has been very dull without him, very dull indeed. Dumbledore thinks very highly of you, as I am sure you know. Oh yes. Holds you in great esteem.」
Dumbledore:「Thank you. Well, Harry, you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow students are going to suffer lasting damage from the night’s events.」
