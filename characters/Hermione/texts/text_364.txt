Sirius:「Well, I’d better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs. I’ll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire, then, shall I? If you can stand to risk it?」
Hermione:「“‘High Inquisitor’?” said Harry darkly, his half-eaten bit of toast slipping from his fingers. “What does that mean?”」
Hermione:「“In a surprise move last night the Ministry of Magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."」
Hermione:「“‘That’s how Dolores Umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at Hogwarts,’ said Weasley last night. ‘Dumbledore couldn’t find anyone, so the Minister put in Umbridge and of course, she’s been an immediate success —’”」
Hermione:「“‘— an immediate success, totally revolutionizing the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts and providing the Minister with on-the-ground feedback about what’s really happening at Hogwarts.’"」
Hermione:「“The Ministry’s new moves have received enthusiastic support from parents of students at Hogwarts."」
