Ron:「Bet Dumbledore wishes he could’ve got rid of Trelawney for good. Mind you, the whole subject’s useless if you ask me, Firenze isn’t a lot better . . .」
Hermione:「How can you say that? After we’ve just found out that there are real prophecies?」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry’s heart began to race. He had not told Ron, Hermione, or anyone else what the prophecy had contained. Neville had told them it had smashed while Harry was pulling him up the steps in the Death Room, and Harry had not yet corrected this impression. He was not ready to see their expressions when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim, there was no other way. . . ."
Hermione:「It is a pity it broke,」
Ron:「Oh all right then, Wish we could come . . .」
Hermione:「Say hello to him for us! And ask him what’s happening about . . . about his little friend!」
