Harry:「Who’s he, to lecture me about being out-of-bounds? After all the stuff he did at school!」
Hermione:「He’s worried about you! Just like Moody and Hagrid! So listen to them!」
Harry:「No one’s tried to attack me all year. No one’s done anything to me at all —」
Hermione:「Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire. And they must’ve done that for a reason, Harry. Snuffles is right. Maybe they’ve been biding their time. Maybe this is the task they’re going to get you.」
Harry:「They didn’t care about attacking Krum, did they? Why didn’t they just polish me off at the same time? They could’ve made it look like Krum and I had a duel or something.」
Hermione:「Harry, I don’t understand it either. I just know there are a lot of odd things going on, and I don’t like it. . . . Moody’s right — Sirius is right — you’ve got to get in training for the third task, straight away. And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you’re not going to go sneaking off alone again.」
Hermione:「Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you! Just try and fall backward!」
