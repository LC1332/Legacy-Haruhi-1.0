Harry:「They both knew that Professor Trelawney was an old fraud, but on the other hand, they loathed Umbridge so much that they felt very much on Trelawney’s side — until she swooped down on them a few seconds later, that was.」
Hermione:「Well? Let me see the start you’ve made on your dream diary, please.」
Narrator:Hermione think "And by the time she had interpreted Harry’s dreams at the top of her voice (all of which, even the ones that involved eating porridge, apparently foretold a gruesome and early death), he was feeling much less sympathetic toward her."
Umbridge:「Well then, proceed to chapter three.」
Hermione:「I’ve read that too. I’ve read the whole book.」
Umbridge:「You disagree?」
Hermione:「Mr. Slinkhard doesn’t like jinxes, does he? But I think they can be very useful when they’re used defensively.」
Hermione:「Don’t you get involved!」
