Hermione:「Don’ worry abou’ me, What’ve you done to him?, you told us none of them wanted to come!, Why — what — oh, Hagrid!, He’s been hurting you all this time, hasn’t he? That’s why you’ve had all these injuries!, So this is why it took you two months to get home!, why did you bring him back if he didn’t want to come, wouldn’t he have been happier with his own people?, Small?」
