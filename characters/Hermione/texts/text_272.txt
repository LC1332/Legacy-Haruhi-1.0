Harry:「Hagrid, look what I’ve got for relatives! Look at the Dursleys!」
Professor Dumbledore:「An excellent point, My own brother, Aberforth, was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat. It was all over the papers, but did Aberforth hide? No, he did not! He held his head high and went about his business as usual! Of course, I’m not entirely sure he can read, so that may not have been bravery. . . .」
Hermione:「Come back and teach, Hagrid, please come back, we really miss you.」
