Death Eater:「Accio Cloak! Not under your wrapper, then, Potter? Spread out. He’s here. We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll find you! What about dementors? Let ’em have free rein, they’d find him quick enough! The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his — an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s life, not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!」
Hermione:「Let’s just leave! Disapparate now! We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!」
