:Ron looking blank
Ron:「“And the sword, Why did he want Harry to have the sword?”」
Harry:「“And why couldn’t he just have told me? It was there, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give it to me then?”」
:Harry sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive
Harry:「“Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand?”」
Hermione:「“And as for this book, The Tales of Beedle the Bard . . . I’ve never even heard of them!”」
