Harry:「Now what?」
Hermione:「We’ll have to hide in here. We need to wait until they’ve gone back to the castle. Then we wait until it’s safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius’s window. He won’t be there for another couple of hours. . . . Oh, this is going to be difficult. . . .」
Harry:「We’re going to have to move. We’ve got to be able to see the Whomping Willow, or we won’t know what’s going on.」
Hermione:「Okay. But we’ve got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember. . . .」
Harry:「There’s Ron!」
Harry:「Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here —」
Harry:「There’s Sirius!」
Harry:「Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it? Ouch — look, I just got walloped by the tree — and so did you — this is weird —」
Hermione:「That was Crookshanks pressing the knot.」
Hermione:「Right after we’d gone down into the passage! If only Dumbledore had come with us . . .」
Hermione:「Here comes Lupin!」
