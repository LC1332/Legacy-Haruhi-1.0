Harry:「Voldemort! What’s happening? What’s he up to? Where is he? What are we doing to stop him?」
Hermione:「We’ve told you, the Order don’t let us in on their meetings. So we don’t know the details — but we’ve got a general idea —」
Ron:「Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears, see. They’re really useful.」
Harry:「Extendable — ?」
Ron:「Ears, yeah. Only we’ve had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk. Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them. But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realized what was going on. We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters, keeping tabs on them, you know —」
Hermione:「— some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order —」
