Neville:「That’s right, and his Death Eaters too . . . People should know . . .」
Hermione:「what happened on your date with Cho? How come you were back so early?」
Harry:「a complete fiasco, now you mention it.」
Harry:「she jumps up, right, and says ‘I’ll see you around, Harry,’ and runs out of the place!」
Hermione:「Oh, Harry, Well, I’m sorry, but you were a bit tactless.」
Harry:「you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along, how was I supposed to do that without telling her — ?」
Hermione:「You should have told her differently, You should have said it was really annoying, but I’d made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks, and you really didn’t want to go, you’d much rather spend the whole day with her, but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please, please come along with you, and hopefully you’d be able to get away more quickly? And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too,」
