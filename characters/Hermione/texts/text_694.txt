Phineas Nigellus:「It belongs to Professor Snape’s school. Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood oddity!」
Hermione:「Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!」
Phineas Nigellus:「Where am I? Where have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?」
Harry:「How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?」
Phineas Nigellus:「Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.」
Hermione:「Hagrid’s not an oaf!」
