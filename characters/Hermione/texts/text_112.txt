Fred:「Excellent. I need to visit Zonko’s. I’m nearly out of Stink Pellets.」
Hermione:「Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time. They’re bound to catch Black soon. He’s been sighted once already.」
Ron:「Black’s not fool enough to try anything in Hogsmeade. Ask McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next one might not be for ages —」
Harry:「Yeah, I think I will.」
Hermione:「Does he have to eat that in front of us?」
Harry:「You can copy mine, if you like.」
:Hermione disapproved of copying
Ron:「OY! GET OFF, YOU STUPID ANIMAL!」
Hermione:「Ron, don’t hurt him!」
Hermione:「Crookshanks doesn’t understand it’s wrong! All cats chase rats, Ron!」
Hermione:「How’s Scabbers?」
Lavender Brown:「She got a letter from home this morning. It’s her rabbit, Binky. He’s been killed by a fox.」
Hermione:「I’m sorry, Lavender.」
