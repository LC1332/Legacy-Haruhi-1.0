Harry:「Should we say something? About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?」
Hermione:「’Course not, he’ll recover,」
Ron:「Anyway, more trouble for Umbridge, isn’t it?」
Harry:「Reparo! That’s all very well, but what if Montague’s permanently injured?」
Hermione:「Who cares? Montague shouldn’t have tried to take all those points from Gryffindor, should he? If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me!」
Ron:「It’ll be my fault Fred and George left, you wait. She’ll say I should’ve stopped them leaving, I should’ve grabbed the ends of their brooms and hung on or something. . . . Yeah, it’ll be all my fault . . .」
Hermione:「Well, if she does say that it’ll be very unfair, you couldn’t have done anything! But I’m sure she won’t, I mean, if it’s really true they’ve got premises in Diagon Alley now, they must have been planning this for ages . . .」
Harry:「Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June.」
Hermione:「Oh, Harry, you didn’t!」
