Harry:「I think I’ll write and tell Sirius about it, see what he thinks —」
Hermione:「Harry, you can’t put something like that in a letter! Don’t you remember, Moody told us to be careful what we put in writing! We just can’t guarantee owls aren’t being intercepted anymore!」
Harry:「All right, all right, I won’t tell him, then! I’m going to bed. Tell Ron for me, will you?」
Hermione:「Oh no, if you’re going that means I can go without being rude too, I’m absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow. Listen, you can help me if you like, it’s quite fun, I’m getting better, I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now.」
