Neville:「You all right, Neville? Oh yes, I’m fine, thanks. Just reading this book Professor Moody lent me. . . . Apparently, Professor Sprout told Professor Moody I’m really good at Herbology, Neville said. There was a faint note of pride in his voice that Harry had rarely heard there before. He thought I’d like this.」
Hermione:「I was going to have a fight. Okay, I’ll lose a bet.」
