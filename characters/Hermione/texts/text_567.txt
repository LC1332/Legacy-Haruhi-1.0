Hermione:「Oh, hello, Harry. I was just practicing.」
Harry:「He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that she had merely left the room because the party was a little too rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations.” “Er . . . does he?” said Harry.」
Hermione:「Don’t pretend you didn’t see him. He wasn’t exactly hiding it, was — ?」

:Harry frequent nighttime wanderings, navigate mistletoe-free routes between classes
