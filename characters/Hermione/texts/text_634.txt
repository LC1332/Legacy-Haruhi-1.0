Harry:「It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched.」
Hermione:「But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can’t exist without it.」
Harry:「That diary sort of died when I stabbed it. And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.」
Ron:「The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?」
Hermione:「While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don’t mean holding it for too long, it’s nothing to do with touching it. I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.」
Hermione:「we will . . . we’re sorry . . .」
