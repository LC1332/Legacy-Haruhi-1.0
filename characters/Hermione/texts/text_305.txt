Harry:「He’ll never keep Rita quiet. Not on a story like this.」
Hermione:「Oh, Rita hasn’t written anything at all since the third task. As a matter of fact, Rita Skeeter isn’t going to be writing anything at all for a while. Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her.」
Ron:「What are you talking about?」
Hermione:「I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she wasn’t supposed to be coming onto the grounds. Well, it was you, really, who gave me the idea, Harry. Did I? How? Bugging.」
Hermione:「Oh yes she is. I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing. Look very closely, and you’ll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears.」
Ron:「When we saw Malfoy under that tree . . .」
Hermione:「He was talking to her, in his hand. He knew, of course. That’s how she’s been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins. They wouldn’t care that she was doing something illegal, as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid.」
