Harry:「I’ve been thinking, and —」
Hermione:「Harry, could you help me with something?」
Hermione:「Look at that symbol, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story, there was a picture of what looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.」
Harry:「Isn’t it the same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?」
Hermione:「Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.」
Hermione:「Grindelwald’s mark? I’ve never heard that Grindelwald had a mark. There’s no mention of it in anything I’ve ever read about him.」
Harry:「Yeah, it is weird. And you’d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.」
Hermione:「I know. . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures over the titles.」
