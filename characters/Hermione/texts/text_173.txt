Hermione:「“What did you do?” she said fiercely. “You said you were only going to keep a lookout!”」
Harry:「“I just saved all our lives . . . ,” said Harry. “Get behind here — behind this bush — I’ll explain.”」
Hermione:「“Did anyone see you?”」
Harry:「“I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because I’d already done it. . . . Does that make sense?”」
Hermione:「“Right, it’s nearly time,” said Hermione tensely, looking at her watch. “We’ve got about forty-five minutes until Dumbledore locks the door to the hospital wing. We’ve got to rescue Sirius and get back into the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing. . . .”」
