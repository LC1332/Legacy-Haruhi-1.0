Bellatrix:「You are lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!」
Bellatrix:「What else did you take? What else have you got? Tell me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!」
Ron:「There’s no way out, Ron, The cellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.」
Hermione:「What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!」
Hermione:「We only met him tonight! We’ve never been inside your vault. . . . It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just a copy!」
