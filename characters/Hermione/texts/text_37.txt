Harry:「All — all three of us? Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?」
Hermione:「Of course not. How do you think you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through my books, there might be something useful. . . .」
Hermione:「Not if I can help it. Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They’re not throwing me out after that.」
Neville:「What are you doing?」
Harry:「Nothing, Neville, nothing.」
Neville:「You’re going out again.」
Hermione:「No, no, no, we’re not. Why don’t you go to bed, Neville?」
