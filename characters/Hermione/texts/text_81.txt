Ron:「Hagrid had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d christened “Fluffy.”」
Hermione:「Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody.」
Harry:「Harry half wished he hadn’t found out how to work Riddle’s diary.」
Ron:「“Riddle might have got the wrong person,” said Hermione. “Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people. . . .”」
Hermione:「“How many monsters d’you think this place can hold?” Ron asked dully.」
Hermione:「“But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” said Hermione.」
Harry:「“He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said Harry quickly.」
Hermione:「“Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?”」
