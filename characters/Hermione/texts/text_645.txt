Ron:「“All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s, aren’t they? ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’ . . . ‘The Wizard and the Hopping Pot’ . . . ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ . . .”」
Hermione:「“What was that last one?”」
:Ron looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione
Hermione:「“We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ —”」
Ron:「“Yeah, I mean, that’s just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they’re like in the original versions.”」
Hermione:「“But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?”」
