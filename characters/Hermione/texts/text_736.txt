Harry:「But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He even lived with her for a while. . . .」
Hermione:「So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow, you don’t know anything about him, then?」
Harry:「No, I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been anyone famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’ is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher, it lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.」
Ron:「‘Extinct in the male line’?」
Hermione:「It means the name’s died out, centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though, they’d just be called something different.」
