Lupin:「“A dementor,” said Lupin, who was now giving chocolate to everyone else. “One of the dementors of Azkaban.”」
Hermione:「“Are you sure you’re okay, Harry?”」
Harry:「“I don’t get it. . . . What happened?”」
Ron:「“I thought you were having a fit or something,” said Ron, who still looked scared. “You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat and started twitching —”」
Hermione:「“And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the dementor, and pulled out his wand,” said Hermione, “and he said, ‘None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.’ But the dementor didn’t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of glided away. . . .”」
