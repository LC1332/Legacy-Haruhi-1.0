Harry:「Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid.」
Hermione:「It’s just playing into Malfoy’s hands to look worried, it tells him we don’t know exactly what’s going on. We’ve got to ignore him, Harry. Here, hold the bowtruckle for a moment, just so I can draw its face . . .」
Malfoy:「Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry’s really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he’ll probably be sent packing straight away.」
Harry:「OUCH!」
:Crabbe and Goyle action
Harry:「If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time . . .」
Hermione:「Harry, don’t go picking a row with Malfoy, don’t forget, he’s a prefect now, he could make life difficult for you . . .」
Hermione:「I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back, that’s all.」
