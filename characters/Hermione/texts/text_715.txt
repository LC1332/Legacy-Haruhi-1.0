Hermione:「The Deluminator?」
Narrator:Ron think "It doesn’t just turn the lights on and off. I don’t know how it works or why it happened then and not any other time, because I’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard . . . I heard you."
Hermione:「You heard me on the radio?」
Narrator:Ron think "No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice came out of this."
Hermione:「And what exactly did I say?」
