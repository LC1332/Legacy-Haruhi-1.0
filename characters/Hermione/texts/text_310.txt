Harry:「Didn’t work that well, though, did it? Had to look after myself after all, didn’t I?」
Hermione:「He was so angry. Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended. He was scary.」
Harry:「Well, I’m glad he left. If he hadn’t, I wouldn’t have done magic and Dumbledore would probably have left me at Privet Drive all summer.」
Hermione:「Aren’t you . . . aren’t you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing?」
Ron:「We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on. We did, mate. But he’s really busy now, we’ve only seen him twice since we came here and he didn’t have much time, he just made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote, he said the owls might be intercepted —」
Harry:「He could still’ve kept me informed if he’d wanted to」
Hermione:「I thought that too. But he didn’t want you to know anything.」
