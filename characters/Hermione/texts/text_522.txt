He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time — he must think you’ve got a chance!」
Hermione:「I wonder what he’ll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably . . . powerful countercurses . . . anti-jinxes . . .」
Hermione:「I think Dumbledore said our O.W.L. results would be arriving today!」
