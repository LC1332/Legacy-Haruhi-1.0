Umbridge:「“Did you want to ask something about the chapter, dear?” she asked Hermione, as though she had only just noticed her.」
Hermione:「“Not about the chapter, no,” said Hermione.」
Umbridge:「“Well, we’re reading just now,” said Professor Umbridge, showing her small, pointed teeth. “If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.”」
Hermione:「“I’ve got a query about your course aims,” said Hermione.」
Umbridge:「“Well, Miss Granger, I think the course aims are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully,” said Professor Umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness.」
Hermione:「“Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written up there about using defensive spells.”」
