Harry:「Yeah, I suppose you’d better, ’Specially if she thinks they’re receiving stolen cauldrons or something . . .」
Hermione:「said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson」
Harry:「It’s no good nagging me, it’s done, Fred and George have got the gold — spent a good bit of it too, by the sounds of it — and I can’t get it back from them and I don’t want to. So save your breath, Hermione.」
Hermione:「I wasn’t going to say anything about Fred and George!」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry’s heart sank. Once they had exhausted the subject of Fred and George’s dramatic departure, which admittedly had taken many hours, Ron and Hermione had wanted to hear news of Sirius. As Harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to Sirius in the first place, it had been hard to think of things to tell them. He had ended up saying to them truthfully that Sirius wanted Harry to resume Occlumency lessons. He had been regretting this ever since; Hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when Harry least expected it."
Hermione:「You can’t tell me you’ve stopped having funny dreams, because Ron told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again . . .」
