Harry:「I dunno.」
:Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting.
Hermione:「Let’s stay here for now.」
Hermione:「Where are you going?」
Harry:「Tent?」
Hermione:「In the bag!」
Hermione:「Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad, so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!」
Ron:「Don’t say the name!」
Harry:「Dumbledore said fear of a name —」
Ron:「Just — just show You-Know-Who some respect, will you?」
:Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent
Hermione:「With any luck, they’ll have got away, As long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along-Apparition and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. That’s what Harry told her to do.」
Hermione:「Got — got what?」
