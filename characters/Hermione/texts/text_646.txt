Ron:「Nightmare, Muriel is. She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she’ll have written them out of her will — like they care, they’re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they’re going. . . . Wow, You look great! Always the tone of surprise,」
Hermione:「Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn’t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?’ and then, ‘Bad posture and skinny ankles.’」
Ron:「Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,」
George:「Yeah, she’s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings,」
Hermione:「Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?」
Hermione:「Yes, he sounds a real charmer,」
Hermione:「I didn’t know you were — goodness — it’s lovely to see — how are you?」
