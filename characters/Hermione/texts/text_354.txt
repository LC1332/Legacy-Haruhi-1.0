Harry:「Well, said Harry, dropping his voice, it’s a possibility, isn’t it?」
Hermione:「I suppose so, said Hermione, though she sounded unconvinced. But I don’t think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell, I mean, he’s properly alive again now, isn’t he, he’s got his own body, he wouldn’t need to share someone else’s. He could have her under the Imperius Curse, I suppose . . .」
:Harry watched Fred, George, and Lee Jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottles for a moment
Hermione:「But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you, and didn’t Dumbledore say it had to do with what You-Know-Who was feeling at the time? I mean, maybe this hasn’t got anything to do with Umbridge at all, maybe it’s just coincidence it happened while you were with her?」
Harry:「I’m not bothering him with this. Like you just said, it’s not a big deal. It’s been hurting on and off all summer — it was just a bit worse tonight, that’s all —」
Hermione:「Harry, I’m sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this —」
