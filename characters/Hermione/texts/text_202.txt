Ron:「I think I’ve heard of it, Where is it? What country?」
Hermione:「Well, nobody knows, do they?」
Harry:「Er — why not?」
Hermione:「There’s traditionally been a lot of rivalry between all the magic schools. Durmstrang and Beauxbatons like to conceal their whereabouts so nobody can steal their secrets」
Ron:「Just you, then, So go on — how d’you hide a place like Hogwarts?」
Hermione:「It’s bewitched, If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is a moldering old ruin with a sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE.」
Harry:「Come again?」
Hermione:「Well, you can enchant a building so it’s impossible to plot on a map, can’t you?」
