Ron:「How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he’s on our side?」
Hermione:「Well, I don’t know. That is a bit odd . . .」
Harry:「So what’s in the Department of Mysteries? Has your dad ever mentioned anything about it?」
Ron:「I know they call the people who work in there ‘Unspeakables.’ Because no one really seems to know what they do in there. . . . Weird place to have a weapon . . .」
Hermione:「It’s not weird at all, it makes perfect sense. It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing, I expect. . . . Harry, are you sure you’re all right?」
Fred:「Headless Hats! Two Galleons each — watch Fred, now!」
George:「And off again!」
Hermione:「How do those hats work, then? I mean, obviously it’s some kind of Invisibility Spell, but it’s rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object. . . . I’d imagine the charm wouldn’t have a very long life though . . .」
