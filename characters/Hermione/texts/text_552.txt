Harry:「He’s got no chance of persuading Snape, This detention’s already been postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it for anyone else.」
Hermione:「I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!」
Ron:「I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,」
:Hermione anxiously
Harry:「Yeah, mine! I told him at King’s Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it’s not at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts with him —」
Hermione:「But how can he have done, Harry? We were all searched when we arrived, weren’t we?」
:Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while
Harry:「Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then, His mother or someone.」
Hermione:「All the owls are being checked too, Filch told us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach.」
