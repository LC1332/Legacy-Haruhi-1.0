Ron:「She wants a new angle, Hagrid, She should’ve interviewed Snape, ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .’, She should’ve interviewed Snape, said Harry grimly. He’d give her the goods on me any day. ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .’, You were supposed to say Harry’s a mad delinquent!, You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day, Hagrid?, That egg!, Hermione hissed., Springing a test on us on the last day. Ruining the last bit of term with a whole load of studying., Mmm . . . you’re not exactly straining yourself, though, are you?, It’s Christmas, Hermione」
Hermione:「She jus’ wanted me ter talk about you, Harry, She wants a new angle, Hagrid, She should’ve interviewed Snape, ‘Potter has been crossing lines ever since he first arrived at this school. . . .’, That egg!, Hermione hissed., I’d have thought you’d be doing something constructive, Harry, even if you don’t want to learn your antidotes!」
