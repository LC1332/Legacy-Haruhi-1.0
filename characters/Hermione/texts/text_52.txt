Professor Sprout:「We’ll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?」
Hermione:「Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative. It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.」
Professor Sprout:「Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.」
Hermione:「The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it.」
