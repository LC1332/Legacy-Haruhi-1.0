Harry:「See you later, then,」
Hermione:「What was he hiding behind his back?」
Hermione:「Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?」
Ron:「“But it’s against our laws, Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons in the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie’s got off wild ones in Romania.”」
Harry:「“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?”」
Ron:「“Of course there are, Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who’ve spotted them, to make them forget.”」
Hermione:「“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?”」
