Slughorn:「It won’t do, m’boy, I’m determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don’t you?」
Hermione:「Yes, they’re really —」
Slughorn:「So why don’t you come along, Harry?」
Harry:「Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor」
Slughorn:「Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work! But a little recreation never hurt anybody. Now, how about Monday night, you can’t possibly want to practice in this weather. . . .」
Harry:「I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening.」
Slughorn:「Unlucky again! Ah, well . . . you can’t evade me forever, Harry!」
Hermione:「I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one. They’re not that bad, you know. They’re even quite fun sometimes.」
