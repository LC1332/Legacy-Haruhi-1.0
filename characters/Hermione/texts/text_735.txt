Ron:「It’s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.」
Hermione:「Well, I don’t suppose it matters」
Hermione:「Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.」
Hermione:「But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!」
Hermione:「A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we’d have everything we need already!」
Harry:「You said there have been loads of wands — the Deathstick and whatever they were called —」
Hermione:「All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand’s real, what about the Resurrection Stone? No magic can raise the dead, and that’s that!」
