Mrs. Weasley:「I don’t think he’ll be able to, Ron, He’s really very busy at the moment.」
Hermione:「Don’t you go feeling guilty! You belong at Hogwarts and Sirius knows it. Personally, I think he’s being selfish.」
Ron:「That’s a bit harsh, Hermione, you wouldn’t want to be stuck inside this house without company.」
Hermione:「He’ll have company! It’s headquarters to the Order of the Phoenix, isn’t it? He just got his hopes up that Harry would be coming to live here with him.」
Harry:「Come off it!」
Ron:「Suit yourselves. But I sometimes think Ron’s mum’s right, and Sirius gets confused about whether you’re you or your father, Harry.」
Harry:「So you think he’s touched in the head?」
Hermione:「No, I just think he’s been very lonely for a long time.」
Mrs. Weasley:「You were so keen to help the Order, you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in.」
Ron:「I feel like a house-elf.」
Hermione:「Well, now that you understand what dreadful lives they lead, perhaps you’ll be a bit more active in S.P.E.W.!」
