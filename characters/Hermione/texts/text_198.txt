Ron:「But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark? They’d have been pleased to see it, wouldn’t they?」
Narrator:Bill think "Use your brains, Ron, If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they’d ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives. . . . I don’t reckon he’d be over-pleased with them, do you?"
Hermione:「So . . . whoever conjured the Dark Mark . . . were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?」
