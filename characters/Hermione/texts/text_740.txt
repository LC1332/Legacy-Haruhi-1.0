Ron:「Three Horcruxes left, we need a plan of action, come on! Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again. The orphanage . . . Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving. You never know, was Ron’s constant refrain. Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and have a poke around.」
