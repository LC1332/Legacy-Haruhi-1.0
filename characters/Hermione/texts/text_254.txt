Narrator:Winky think "Oh you is a bad elf, Dobby! My poor Mr. Crouch, what is he doing without Winky? He is needing me, he is needing my help! I is looking after the Crouches all my life, and my mother is doing it before me, and my grandmother is doing it before her . . . oh what is they saying if they knew Winky was freed? Oh the shame, the shame!"

Winky:「You is seeing my master? You is seeing him here at Hogwarts?」
Hermione:「Yes, he and Mr. Bagman are judges in the Triwizard Tournament.」
