Harry:「blinked. He had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there. It had flashed into sight and vanished immediately. No . . . it could not have been. . . . He had imagined it because he had been thinking about Sirius」
Hermione:「Okay, write that down, and then copy out this conclusion that I’ve written for you」
Ron:「Hermione, you are honestly the most wonderful person I’ve ever met, and if I’m ever rude to you again —」
Hermione:「I’ll know you’re back to normal」
Ron:「Er — Harry? Why are you down there?」
Harry:「Because I’ve just seen Sirius’s head in the fire」
Harry:「spoke quite calmly; after all, he had seen Sirius’s head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too. Nevertheless, he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time. . . . It had vanished so quickly」
Hermione:「Sirius’s head? You mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the Triwizard Tournament? But he wouldn’t do that now, it would be too — Sirius!」
