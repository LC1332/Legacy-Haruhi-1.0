Harry:「It’s tonight. Snape’s going through the trapdoor tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.」
Hermione:「But what can we —」
Hermione:「Good afternoon.」
Harry:「Right, here’s what we’ve got to do. One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.」
Ron:「Why me?」
Harry:「It’s obvious. You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know. ‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong. . . .’」
Hermione:「Oh, shut up.」
Harry:「At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail.」
Hermione:「I’m sorry, Harry! Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where Snape went.」
