Ollivander:「The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack, but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry was unsure of how much he liked Ollivander. The idea of the Dark wizard in possession of the wand enthralled and repulsed him."
Hermione:「You — you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?」
Narrator:Ollivander think "Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand’s course through history. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned in wandlore recognize."
Hermione:「So you — you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?」
