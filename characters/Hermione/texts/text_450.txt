Hagrid:「I’ll be seein’ yeh, Harry. . . . Take care now . . .」
Hermione:「Harry! Harry, over here!」
Hermione:「You’re early! I thought you were with Cho, I wasn’t expecting you for another hour at least!」
Harry:「What are you up to?」
Rita Skeeter:「Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived」
Rita Skeeter:「I suppose I’m allowed to talk to him, am I?」
Hermione:「Yes, I suppose you are」
Rita Skeeter:「They’ve run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year without my help, How has that made you feel, Harry? Betrayed? Distraught? Misunderstood?」
Hermione:「He feels angry, of course, Because he’s told the Minister of Magic the truth and the Minister’s too much of an idiot to believe him.」
