Harry:「And he recounted the story of sending his letter to Sirius and Filch bursting in seconds later, demanding to see the letter. To his slight surprise, Hermione found this story highly interesting, much more, indeed, than he did himself.」
Hermione:「He said he was tipped off you were ordering Dungbombs? But who had tipped him off?」
Harry:「I dunno. Maybe Malfoy, he’d think it was a laugh.」
Hermione:「Malfoy? Well . . . yes . . . maybe . . .」
Hermione:「Oh — no, no, it’s always packed and really noisy. I’ve told the others to meet us in the Hog’s Head, that other pub, you know the one, it’s not on the main road. I think it’s a bit . . . you know . . . dodgy . . . but students don’t normally go in there, so I don’t think we’ll be overheard.」
