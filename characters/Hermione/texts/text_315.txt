Ron:「Yeah, well, your name got dragged into the row. Percy said the only evidence was your word and . . . I dunno . . . he didn’t think it was good enough.」
Hermione:「Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously.」
Harry:「What are you talking about?」
Hermione:「Haven’t — haven’t you been getting the Daily Prophet?」
Harry:「Not cover to cover. If they were going to report anything about Voldemort it would be headline news, wouldn’t it!」
Hermione:「Well, you’d need to read it cover to cover to pick it up, but they — um — they mention you a couple of times a week.」
Hermione:「He’s not a nutter, Ron —」
Ron:「Hermione still hasn’t given up on spew —」
Hermione:「It’s not ‘spew’! It’s the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, and it’s not just me, Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too —」
