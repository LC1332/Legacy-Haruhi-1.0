Hermione:「“Just one, and that reminds me — Harry, Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.”」
Ron:「Oh yeah, you’re right,」
Hagrid:「The library? Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?」
Harry:「Oh, we’re not working, Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who he is.」
Hermione:「We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all, Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?」
