Ron:「Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?」
Hermione:「Times change, Now, show us that Deluminator.」
:Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
Hermione:「The thing is, we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.」
Hermione:「I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!」
Ron:「why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?」
Hermione:「Well, exactly, If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?」
Harry:「Yeah, well, I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?」
Hermione:「What do you mean?」
Ron:「That was the one you nearly swallowed!」
Harry:「Exactly, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch.」
Hermione:「Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!」
