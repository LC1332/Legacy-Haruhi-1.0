Ginny:「She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm.」
Hermione:「And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!」
Harry:「Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament.」
Hermione:「Not you as well!」
Ginny:「I’d much rather have Tonks in the family. At least she’s a laugh.」
Ron:「She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately. Every time I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.」
Hermione:「That’s not fair. She still hasn’t got over what happened . . . you know . . . I mean, he was her cousin!」
Harry:「How does she work that one out?」
Hermione:「Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t she? I think she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have killed Sirius.」
Hermione:「She can’t change her appearance like she used to. I think her powers must have been affected by shock, or something.」
