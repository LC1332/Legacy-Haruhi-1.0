:Harry, Ron, Hermione finalizing their plans for the evening
Hermione:「I’ve got it all worked out, I’ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they’re bound to eat them. Once they’re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.」
Harry and Ron:「Hermione, I don’t think — That could go seriously wrong —」
Hermione:「The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and Goyle’s hair. You do want to investigate Malfoy, don’t you?」
