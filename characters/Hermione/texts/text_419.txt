Ron:「Blimey, Hagrid,」
Hermione:「So how come it’s taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three days?」
Hagrid:「We didn’ leave after three days! Dumbledore was relyin’ on us!」
Hermione:「But you’ve just said there was no way you could go back!」
Hagrid:「No, I wish he had.」
Hermione:「What d’you mean?」
Hagrid:「Yep. Couple of ’em were visitin’ him ev’ry day, bringin’ gifts ter the Gurg, an’ he wasn’ dangling them upside down.」
Ron:「How d’you know they were Death Eaters?」
Hagrid:「Because I recognized one of ’em, Macnair, remember him? Bloke they sent ter kill Buckbeak? Maniac, he is. Likes killin’ as much as Golgomath, no wonder they were gettin’ on so well.」
Hermione:「So Macnair’s persuaded the giants to join You-Know-Who?」
