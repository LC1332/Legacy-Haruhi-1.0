Harry:「I didn’t mean to, I just — lost control.」
Hermione:「It’s not funny, Ron. Honestly, I’m amazed Harry wasn’t expelled.」
Harry:「So am I. Forget expelled, I thought I was going to be arrested. Your dad doesn’t know why Fudge let me off, does he?」
Ron:「Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it? Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate to see what the Ministry’d do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig me up first, because Mum would’ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask Dad yourself this evening. We’re staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too! So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow! Hermione’s there as well!」
Hermione:「Mum and Dad dropped me off this morning with all my Hogwarts things.」
Harry:「What’s all that, Hermione?」
Hermione:「Well, I’m taking more new subjects than you, aren’t I? Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical Creatures, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle Studies —」
