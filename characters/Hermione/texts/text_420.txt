Harry:「So what happened? Did you ever get near any of the other giants?」
Hermione:「What? Oh . . . oh yeah, we did. Yeah, on the third night after Karkus was killed, we crept outta the cave we’d bin hidin’ in and headed back down inter the gully, keepin’ our eyes skinned fer the Death Eaters. Got inside a few o’ the caves, no go — then, in abou’ the sixth one, we found three giants hidin’.」
Ron:「Cave must’ve been cramped.」
Hagrid:「Wasn’ room ter swing a kneazle.」
Hermione:「Didn’t they attack you when they saw you?」
Hermione:「What do you mean ‘at one point,’ Hagrid?」
