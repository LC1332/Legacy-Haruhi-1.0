Harry:「So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville, were you — ?」
Hermione:「Outside Snape’s office, yes, with Luna. We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened. . . . We didn’t know what was going on upstairs, Ron had taken the map. . . . It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don’t think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way into Snape’s office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and — and —」
Harry:「What?」
Hermione:「I was so stupid, Harry! He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he — while he went to help fight the Death Eaters — We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor . . . and oh, it’s so obvious now, Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn’t realize, Harry, we didn’t realize, we just let Snape go!」
