Ron:「No, it’s not.」
Hermione:「All we’d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.」
Ron:「What’s that?」
Harry:「Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —」
Ron:「D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?」
Hermione:「It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.」
Ron:「Hard to see why we’d want the book, really, if we weren’t going to try and make one of the potions.」
Hermione:「I think that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance. . . .」
