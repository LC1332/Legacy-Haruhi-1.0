Ron:「And he sneaked up here to search Snape’s office!, Yeah, it does!, Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape —, Oh give it a rest, Hermione, I know Dumbledore’s brilliant and everything, but that doesn’t mean a really clever Dark wizard couldn’t fool him —, Yeah, you should’ve seen Snape’s face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday!, Karkaroff wanted to talk to Snape, he says Snape’s been avoiding him. Karkaroff looked really worried. He showed Snape something on his arm, but I couldn’t see what it was.」
Hermione:「Look, I don’t care what you say, Dumbledore trusts Snape —, Why did Snape save Harry’s life in the first year, then? Why didn’t he just let him die?, Yeah, it does!」
Hermione:「There’s still the fact that Dumbledore trusts Snape, and I know Dumbledore trusts where a lot of other people wouldn’t, but I just can’t see him letting Snape teach at Hogwarts if he’d ever worked for Voldemort.」
