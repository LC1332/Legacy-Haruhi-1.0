Dobby:「Professor Dumbledore says he will pay Dobby, if Dobby wants paying! Dobby is a free elf, Dobby gets a Galleon a week and one day off a month!」
Hermione:「That’s not very much!」
Dobby:「Professor Dumbledore offered Dobby ten Galleons a week, and weekends off, but Dobby beat him down, Dobby likes freedom, but he isn’t wanting too much, he likes work better.」
Hermione:「And how much is Professor Dumbledore paying you, Winky?」
