Harry:「Where’s Crookshanks?」
Hermione:「Out in the garden, I expect. He likes chasing gnomes. He’s never seen any before.」
Harry:「Percy’s enjoying work, then?」
Ron:「I don’t reckon he’d come home if Dad didn’t make him. He’s obsessed. Just don’t get him onto the subject of his boss. According to Mr. Crouch . . . as I was saying to Mr. Crouch . . . Mr. Crouch is of the opinion . . . Mr. Crouch was telling me . . . They’ll be announcing their engagement any day now.」
Hermione:「Have you had a good summer, Harry? Did you get our food parcels and everything?」
Hermione:「I think they’ve stopped arguing. Shall we go down and help your mum with dinner?」
