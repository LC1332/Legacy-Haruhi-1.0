Harry:「Well then, what about information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know who she is?」
Hermione:「Who?」
Harry:「Bathilda Bagshot, the author of — A History of Magic. So your parents knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.」
Harry:「And she’s still alive, and she lives in Godric’s Hollow, Ron’s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore’s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk to, wouldn’t she?」
Harry:「I understand why you’d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and Dumbledore too. But that wouldn’t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?」
Harry:「It’s not just that. Muriel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth. . . .」
Hermione:「Of course, I can see why that’s upset you, Harry —」
Harry:「I thought I did.」
Hermione:「But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?」
