Harry:「Yeah, well, now you’re back and Ron’s fit, we’ll have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?」
Katie:「No. Everyone’s been asking me, but I haven’t got a clue. The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies’ in the Three Broomsticks.」
Hermione:「You definitely went into the bathroom, then?」
Katie:「Well, I know I pushed open the door, so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my memory’s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo’s. Listen, I’d better go, I wouldn’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back. . . .」
:Harry ponder what she had told them
Hermione:「So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace, to be in the ladies’ bathroom.」
