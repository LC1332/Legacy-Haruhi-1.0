Ron:「So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace to?」
Hermione:「Goodness only knows. But whoever it was has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace.」
Harry:「It could’ve been meant for loads of people. Dumbledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s sided with Dumbledore. Or —」
Hermione:「Or you. Couldn’t have been, or Katie would’ve just turned around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn’t she? I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle?」
Hermione:「Dilligrout」
Hermione:「It wasn’t very well thought-out at all.」
