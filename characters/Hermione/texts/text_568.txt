Harry:「But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school?」
Hermione:「Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions, It’s part of their Owl Order Service.」
Harry:「You know a lot about it.」
Hermione:「It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer, I don’t go around putting potions in people’s drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as bad. . . .」
Harry:「Come on, why not?」
Hermione:「Look, Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses, and concealment charms, don’t they? They’re used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects. They’d have picked up a powerful curse, like the one on that necklace, within seconds. But something that’s just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway, love potions aren’t Dark or dangerous —」
