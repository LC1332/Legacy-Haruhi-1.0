Harry:「Dumbledore said we wouldn’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!」
Hermione:「Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?」
Hermione:「He’s asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught」

Hermione:「Harry, you can’t be thinking of going. It’s such a pointless thing to get detention for」
Ron:「get lucky!」
Hermione:「Felix Felicis?」
