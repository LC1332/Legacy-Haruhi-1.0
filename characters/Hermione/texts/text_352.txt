Harry:「D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me?」
Hermione:「Oh, for heaven’s sake, Harry, you can do better than her. Ginny’s told me all about her, apparently she’ll only believe in things as long as there’s no proof at all. Well, I wouldn’t expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler.」
