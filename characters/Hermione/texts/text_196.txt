Mr. Weasley:「Come on, you three」
Hermione:「What’s going to happen to Winky?」
Mr. Weasley:「I don’t know」
Hermione:「The way they were treating her! Mr. Diggory, calling her ‘elf’ all the time . . . and Mr. Crouch! He knows she didn’t do it and he’s still going to sack her! He didn’t care how frightened she’d been, or how upset she was — it was like she wasn’t even human!」
