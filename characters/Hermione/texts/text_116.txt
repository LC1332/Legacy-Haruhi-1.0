Ron:「Do you think Black’s still in the castle?」
Hermione:「Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be.」
Ron:「It’s very lucky he picked tonight, you know. The one night we weren’t in the tower. . . .」
Hermione:「The castle’s protected by more than walls, you know. There are all sorts of enchantments on it, to stop people entering by stealth. You can’t just Apparate in here. And I’d like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They’re guarding every single entrance to the grounds. They’d have seen him fly in too. And Filch knows all the secret passages, they’ll have them covered. . . .」
