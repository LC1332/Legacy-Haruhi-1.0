Harry:「And — what, Hermione?」
Hermione:「I also think we ought to have a name. It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don’t you think?」
Angelina:「Can we be the Anti-Umbridge League?」
Fred:「Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group?」
Hermione:「I was thinking, more of a name that didn’t tell everyone what we were up to, so we can refer to it safely outside meetings.」
Hermione:「All in favor of the D.A.? That’s a majority — motion passed!」
