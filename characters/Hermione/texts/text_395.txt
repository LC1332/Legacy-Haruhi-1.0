Ron:「Hey, that’s an idea!」
Hermione:「Well, Sirius, it’s just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school, and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you’d wanted to. But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus, so we wouldn’t need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee —」
Sirius:「Fair point.」
Hermione:「Fred and George told me it’s blocked.」
Harry:「Sirius?」
Hermione:「Why did he — ?」
Hermione:「Umbridge has been reading your mail, Harry. There’s no other explanation.」
Hermione:「Watch your frog, it’s escaping.」
