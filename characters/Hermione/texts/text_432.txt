Harry:「That dream I had about your dad and the snake, though —」
Hermione:「Harry, you’ve had these dreams before. You had flashes of what Voldemort was up to last year.」
Harry:「This was different. I was inside that snake. It was like I was the snake. . . . What if Voldemort somehow transported me to London — ?」
Hermione:「One day, you’ll read Hogwarts: A History, and perhaps that will remind you that you can’t Apparate or Disapparate inside Hogwarts. Even Voldemort couldn’t just make you fly out of your dormitory, Harry.」
