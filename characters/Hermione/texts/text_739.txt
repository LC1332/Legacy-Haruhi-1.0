Narrator:Harry think "They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione’s flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes."
Hermione:「Obsession? We’re not the ones with an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!」
Harry:「‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’」
Hermione:「I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?」
