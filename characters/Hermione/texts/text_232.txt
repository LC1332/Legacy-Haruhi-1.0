Seamus:「And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory. But I wouldn’t have thought he’d have wanted to risk his good looks.」
Hermione:「Listen!」
Angelina Johnson:「Well, I’ve done it! Just put my name in!」
Ron:「Are you seventeen, then?」
Harry:「’Course she is, can’t see a beard, can you?」
Angelina Johnson:「I had my birthday last week.」
Hermione:「I really hope you get it, Angelina!」
Ron:「What’re we going to do today, then?」
Harry:「We haven’t been down to visit Hagrid yet.」
Ron:「Okay, just as long as he doesn’t ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts.」
Hermione:「I’ve just realized — I haven’t asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet! Wait for me, will you, while I nip upstairs and get the badges?」
