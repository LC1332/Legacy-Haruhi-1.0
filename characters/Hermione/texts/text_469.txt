And then there was the matter of Fred and George, whose diversion was already planned, not to mention the knife Sirius had given him, which was currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father’s old Invisibility Cloak. . . . But the fact remained that if he were caught . . ."

Hermione:「Harry, don’t do it, please don’t do it!」
