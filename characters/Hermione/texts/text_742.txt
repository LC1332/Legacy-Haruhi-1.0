Greyback:「said "Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit quicker at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly?"」
Hermione:「said "Penelope Clearwater."」
Scabior:「said "What’s your blood status?"」
Hermione:「said "Half-blood."」
Scabior:「said "Left, ’ave you, ginger? And you decided to go camping? And you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the Dark Lord’s name?"」
Ron:「said "Nod a laugh, Accident?"」
Greyback:「said "You know who used to like using the Dark Lord’s name, Weasley? The Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?"」
Ron:「said "Doh."」
Hermione:「Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that way. We’ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!」
Ron:「No」
Hermione:「No」
