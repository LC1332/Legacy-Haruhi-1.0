Harry:「Is that what she was doing? Well, wouldn’t it have been easier if she’d just asked me whether I liked her better than you?」
Hermione:「Girls don’t often ask questions like that,」
Harry:「Well, they should! Then I could’ve just told her I fancy her, and she wouldn’t have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying!」
Hermione:「I’m not saying what she did was sensible, I’m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time,」
Ron:「It was a nightmare,」
Hermione:「Oh come on, I’m sure it wasn’t that —」
George:「Actually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never let her play with us . . .,」
Hermione:「She’s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren’t looking,」
