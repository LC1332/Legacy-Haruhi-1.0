Ron:「She’s an awful woman」
Hermione:「Awful. You know, I was just saying to Ron when you came in . . . we’ve got to do something about her」
Ron:「I suggested poison」
Hermione:「No . . . I mean, something about what a dreadful teacher she is, and how we’re not going to learn any defense from her at all」
Hermione:「Well, I was thinking today . . .」
Hermione:「learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves」
Ron:「We can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them, I suppose」
Hermione:「No, we need a teacher, a proper one, who can show us how to use the spells and correct us if we’re going wrong.」
Harry:「About me what?」
Ron:「That’s an idea. You teaching us to do it.」
Harry:「But I’m not a teacher, I can’t —」
Hermione:「Harry, you’re the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts.」
Hermione:「But I’m not talking about test results, Harry. Look what you’ve done!」
