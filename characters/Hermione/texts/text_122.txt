Lupin:「Well . . . all right. I’ll try and help. But it’ll have to wait until next term, I’m afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill.」
Narrator:Harry think "What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the thought that he might never have to hear his mother’s death again, and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quidditch match at the end of November, Harry’s mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although they could not afford to lose another match. Wood became repossessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harry saw no hint of a dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore’s anger seemed to be keeping them at their stations at the entrances."
Narrator:Harry think "To everyone’s delight except Harry’s, there was to be another Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term."
Hermione:「We can do all our Christmas shopping there! Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes!」
