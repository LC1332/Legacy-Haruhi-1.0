Ron:「Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?」
Hermione:「Yes, but it would be excruciatingly painful.」
Harry:「Why? How do you do it?」
Hermione:「Remorse. You’ve got to really feel what you’ve done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?」
Harry:「What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?」
Ron:「Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then. I was wondering what we were going to do with them.」
Hermione:「It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang. It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly rare —」
Ron:「But even if we wreck the thing it lives in, why can’t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?」
Hermione:「Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.」
