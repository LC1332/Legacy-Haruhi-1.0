Hagrid:「I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow! All on his own! At Christmas.」
Hermione:「You’ll have to put up a good strong defense, Hagrid. I’m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.」
Hagrid:「Won’t make no diff’rence! Them Disposal devils, they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case, Buckbeak —」
Harry:「What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?」
Hagrid:「He’s done more’n enough fer me already, Got enough on his plate what with keepin’ them dementors outta the castle, an’ Sirius Black lurkin’ around —」
:Ron and Hermione looked quickly at Harry, as though expecting him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about Black
Harry:「Listen, Hagrid, you can’t give up. Hermione’s right, you just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses —」
Hermione:「I’m sure I’ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting, where the hippogriff got off. I’ll look it up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened.」
