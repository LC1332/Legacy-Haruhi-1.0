Harry:「It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here, you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something.」
Hermione:「Ron,」
Ron:「I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,」
Harry:「Yeah, I thought I did too.」
Harry:「So what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations? Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?」
Ron:「We thought you knew what you were doing! We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had a real plan!」
Hermione:「Ron!」
