Harry:「What do you reckon’s next?」
Hermione:「We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s . . .」
Harry:「All right?」
Harry:「I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one. Come on, I can’t breathe.」
Harry:「Snape’s. What do we have to do?」
Hermione:「Brilliant. This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic, they’d be stuck in here forever.」
Harry:「But how do we know which to drink?」
Hermione:「Give me a minute.」
Hermione:「Which one will get you back through the purple flames?」
Hermione:「Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.」
Harry:「You drink first. You are sure which is which, aren’t you?」
Hermione:「Positive. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.」
