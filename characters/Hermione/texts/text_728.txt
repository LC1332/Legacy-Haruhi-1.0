Ron:「One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.’ ‘Wand of elder, never prosper.’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.」
Hermione:「Harry and I were raised by Muggles. We were taught different superstitions. I think you’re right. It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift is best, which one you’d choose —」

Hermione:「Whereas the wand would be bound to attract trouble —」
Harry:「There have?」
Hermione:「The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other.」
