Hermione:「The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.」
Harry:「“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry.」
Ron:「“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old subjects, or I’d’ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.”」
Hermione:「“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked.」
