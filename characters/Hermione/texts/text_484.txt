Harry:「Good idea. Well . . . see you later, then, Hagrid . . .」
Hermione:「I don’t believe him. I don’t believe him. I really don’t believe him . . .」
Harry:「Calm down」
Hermione:「A giant! A giant in the forest! And we’re supposed to give him English lessons! Always assuming, of course, we can get past the herd of murderous centaurs on the way in and out! I — don’t — believe — him!」
:Harry glared at her
:Hermione eyes filled slowly with tears
Hermione:「But why does he have to make life so difficult for himself — for us?」
Hermione:「And I wish they’d stop singing that stupid song, haven’t they gloated enough?」
:Harry slowly
Hermione:「No!」
:Harry save news till tomorrow
Hermione:「Yes, all right. I’m not in any hurry . . .」
Hermione:「Yes, I’m starting to think he has. But unfortunately, he made Harry and me promise.」
