Harry:「Hello, I brought you this. . . . Want to go for a walk?」
Hermione:「Good idea.」
Harry:「Well, of course I knew you hadn’t entered yourself. The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name! But the question is, who did put it in? Because Moody’s right, Harry . . . I don’t think any student could have done it . . . they’d never be able to fool the goblet, or get over Dumbledore’s —」
Harry:「Have you seen Ron?」
Hermione:「Erm . . . yes . . . he was at breakfast.」
Harry:「What’s that supposed to mean, ‘not really’?」
Hermione:「Oh Harry, isn’t it obvious? He’s jealous!」
Harry:「Great. Really great. Tell him from me I’ll swap any time he wants. Tell him from me he’s welcome to it. . . . People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go. . . .」
Hermione:「I’m not telling him anything. Tell him yourself. It’s the only way to sort this out.」
