Ron:「Why d’you have to keep changing owls?」
Hermione:「Hedwig’ll attract too much attention. She stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he’s hiding . . . I mean, they’re not native birds, are they?」
Harry:「Thanks, Hedwig,」
Harry:「There was a pleasant feeling of anticipation in the air that day. Nobody was very attentive in lessons, being much more interested in the arrival that evening of the people from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang; even Potions was more bearable than usual, as it was half an hour shorter. When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurried up to Gryffindor Tower, deposited their bags and books as they had been instructed, pulled on their cloaks, and rushed back downstairs into the entrance hall.」
Professor McGonagall:「Weasley, straighten your hat. Miss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.」
Harry:「Nearly six. How d’you reckon they’re coming? The train?」
Hermione:「I doubt it.」
