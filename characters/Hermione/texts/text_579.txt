Slughorn:「called for silence from the front of the room. “Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to get through this afternoon! Golpalott’s Third Law . . . who can tell me — ? But Miss Granger can, of course!”」
Hermione:「recited at top speed: “Golpalott’s-Third-Law-states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components.”」
Slughorn:「beamed and said, “Ten points for Gryffindor! Now, if we accept Golpalott’s Third Law as true . . .”」
Slughorn:「finished his explanation, “I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good luck, and don’t forget your protective gloves!”」
Hermione:「said brightly as she straightened up. “You have to understand the principles involved this time. No shortcuts or cheats!”」
