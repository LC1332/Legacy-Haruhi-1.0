Harry:「We were there. We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!」
Narrator:Ron think "Yeah, well, that would’ve been me. Your protective spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent."
Hermione:「No, actually. We’ve been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early, because, as Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.」
Narrator:Ron think "Well, I stayed on that hill all day. I kept hoping you’d appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end — and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe first, obviously."
Hermione:「You saw the what?」
