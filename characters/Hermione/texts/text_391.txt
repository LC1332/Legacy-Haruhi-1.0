Umbridge:「No marks again, then, Potter. You will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion, indicating how and why you went wrong, to be handed in next lesson, do you understand?」
Hermione:「You can’t skive off Divination」
Ron:「Hark who’s talking, you walked out of Divination, you hate Trelawney!」
Hermione:「I don’t hate her, I just think she’s an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud. . . . But Harry’s already missed History of Magic and I don’t think he ought to miss anything else today!」
