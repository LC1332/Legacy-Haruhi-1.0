Harry:「We know —」
Remus John Lupin:「I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry. Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.」
Hermione:「I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me.」
Remus John Lupin:「So, you came straight here after the wedding?」
Harry:「No, only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a café on Tottenham Court Road.」
Remus John Lupin:「But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they disappear!」
Harry:「And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, does it?」
Hermione:「We wondered whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?」
