Harry:「Just you and Ron, yeah?」
Hermione:「Well, well . . . now, don’t fly off the handle again, Harry, please. . . . But I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn. I mean, we’re talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort — oh, don’t be pathetic, Ron — it doesn’t seem fair if we don’t offer the chance to other people.」
Harry:「Yeah, but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me. I’m a nutter, remember?」
Hermione:「Well, I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you’ve got to say. Look, you know the first weekend in October’s a Hogsmeade weekend? How would it be if we tell anyone who’s interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over?」
