Hermione:「Um . . . what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class, Hagrid?」
Hagrid:「Oh, don’ you worry abou’ that, I’ve got a great load o’ lessons planned, I’ve bin keepin’ a couple o’ creatures saved fer yer O.W.L. year, you wait, they’re somethin’ really special.」
Hermione:「Erm . . . special in what way?」
Hagrid:「Dangerous? Don’ be silly, I wouldn’ give yeh anythin’ dangerous! I mean, all righ’, they can look after themselves —」
Hermione:「you’ve got to pass Umbridge’s inspection, and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks, how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs, stuff like that!」
