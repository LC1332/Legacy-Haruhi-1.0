Ron:「And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens? Throw it away and punch him on the nose」
Hermione:「Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?」
Hermione:「I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying — Bet you could」
Ron:「Good-bye」
Narrator:Harry think "All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it."
Ron:「Half-past eleven, we’d better go」
Hermione:「I can’t believe you’re going to do this, Harry」
