Ginny:「Don’t! Don’t laugh —」
Hermione:「Why weren’t you two at dinner?」
Ginny:「Because — oh shut up laughing, you two — because they’ve both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball!」
Ron:「Thanks a bunch, Ginny.」
Hermione:「All the good-looking ones taken, Ron? Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now, is she? Well, I’m sure you’ll find someone somewhere who’ll have you.」
Ron:「Well — you can come with one of us!」
Hermione:「No, I can’t.」
Ron:「You just said that to get rid of Neville!」
Hermione:「Just because it’s taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted I’m a girl!」
