Harry:「He wondered how the other champions were feeling. Every time he had seen Cedric lately, he had been surrounded by admirers and looking nervous but excited. Harry glimpsed Fleur Delacour from time to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, haughty and unruffled. And Krum just sat in the library, poring over books.」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry thought of Sirius, and the tight, tense knot in his chest seemed to ease slightly. He would be speaking to him in just over twelve hours, for tonight was the night they were meeting at the common room fire — assuming nothing went wrong, as everything else had done lately. . . ."
Hermione:「Look, it’s Hagrid!」
Hagrid:「All right, Hermione?」
Hermione:「Hello.」
Moody:「Yeah, it can see through Invisibility Cloaks. And it’s come in useful at times, I can tell you.」
Hagrid:「Harry, meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin. Wear that Cloak.」
Harry:「Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight?」
Hermione:「I wonder what he’s up to? I don’t know whether you should go, Harry. . . . It might make you late for Sirius.」
