Harry:「R.A.B. I think I’ve found him.」
Hermione:「Sirius’s brother?」
Harry:「He was a Death Eater, Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and tried to leave — so they killed him.」
Hermione:「That fits! If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!」
Ron:「What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus Arcturus . . . Regulus . . . R.A.B.! The locket — you don’t reckon — ?」
Harry:「Let’s find out.」
:Hermione spell to the door handle
Hermione:「They’re all about Voldemort. Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters. . . .」
:Ron searching under the wardrobe
:Harry approached the desk
:Hermione spell to summon the locket
Harry:「Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave.」
Ron:「How are we supposed to find it then?」
Hermione:「We search manually.」
