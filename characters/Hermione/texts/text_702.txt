:He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. 
Hermione:「I’m sure it is, They . . . they’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.」
Narrator:Harry think "felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square, however, she stopped dead."
Harry:「look!」
Hermione:「pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother’s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps.」
