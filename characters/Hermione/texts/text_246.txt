Harry:「Hermione — I need you to help me.」
Hermione:「What d’you think I’ve been trying to do, Harry?」
Harry:「Hermione, I need to learn how to do a Summoning Charm properly by tomorrow afternoon.」
Harry:「Concentrate, Harry, concentrate. . . .」
Harry:「What d’you think I’m trying to do? A great big dragon keeps popping up in my head for some reason. . . . Okay, try again. . . .」
Harry:「Well, that’s good, just as long as it’s not drawn-out. I don’t want to suffer.」
Harry:「That’s better, Harry, that’s loads better.」
Hermione:「Well, now we know what to do next time I can’t manage a spell.」
