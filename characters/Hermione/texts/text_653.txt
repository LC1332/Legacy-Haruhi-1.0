Hermione:「Ron, we can’t!」
Ron:「Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!」
Hermione:「We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to know?」
Ron:「Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?」
Hermione:「I’ve been practicing and I think so.」
Hermione:「Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom.」
