Harry:「he wished that he had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was like resisting the urge to be sick.」
:Harry pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall
Hermione:「Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father.」
:Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa
:Hermione gripping Ron's arm
Harry:「It’s not a problem, said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. It’s your family, ’course you’re worried. I’d feel the same way. I do feel the same way.」
Hermione:「I don’t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought and camp in here tonight?」
