Harry:「Hermione, why didn’t you come to Charms?」
Hermione:「What? Oh no! I forgot to go to Charms!」
Harry:「But how could you forget? You were with us till we were right outside the classroom!」
Hermione:「I don’t believe it! Was Professor Flitwick angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track of things!」
:Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor Trelawney’s classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely harrassed
Ron:「I thought we weren’t starting crystal balls until next term」
Harry:「Don’t complain, this means we’ve finished palmistry」
Professor Trelawney:「Good day to you! I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I had planned. The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice.」
Hermione:「Well, honestly . . . ‘the fates have informed her’ . . . who sets the exam? She does! What an amazing prediction!」
