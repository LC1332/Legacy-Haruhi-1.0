Scrimgeour:「glared at him for another moment, then turned and limped away without another word.」
Hermione:「What did Scrimgeour want?」
Harry:「Same as he wanted at Christmas, Wanted me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the Ministry’s new poster boy.」
Ron:「Look, let me go back and hit Percy!」
Hermione:「No, she said firmly, grabbing his arm.」
Harry:「I’m going back to the Dursleys’ once more, because Dumbledore wanted me to, said Harry. But it’ll be a short visit, and then I’ll be gone for good.」
Hermione:「But where will you go if you don’t come back to school?」
Harry:「We’ll be there, Harry.」
Ron:「At your aunt and uncle’s house. And then we’ll go with you wherever you’re going.」
Harry:「No —」
Hermione:「You said to us once before that there was time to turn back if we wanted to. We’ve had time, haven’t we?」
