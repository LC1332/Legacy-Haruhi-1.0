Ron:「Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there.」
Hermione:「I think it’ll be part of the magic of the room. If you need it to be Unplottable, it will be.」
Harry:「Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy’s doing?」
Dobby:「No, Harry Potter, that is impossible.」
Harry:「No, it’s not. Malfoy got into our headquarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no problem.」
Hermione:「But I don’t think you will, Harry. Malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he, because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t know what to ask it to transform into.」
