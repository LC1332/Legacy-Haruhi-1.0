Rita Skeeter:「Well, good-bye, Harry! Until Friday night, then, Hagrid!」
Narrator:Harry think "She’ll twist everything he says."
Hermione:「Just as long as he didn’t import those skrewts illegally or anything. Hagrid’s been in loads of trouble before, and Dumbledore’s never sacked him. Worst that can happen is Hagrid’ll have to get rid of the skrewts. Sorry . . . did I say worst? I meant best.」
