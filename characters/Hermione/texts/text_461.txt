Parvati:「I’ll bet you wish you hadn’t given up Divination now, don’t you, Hermione?」
Hermione:「Not really, I’ve never really liked horses.」
Lavender:「He’s not a horse, he’s a centaur!」
Parvati:「Either way, he’s still got four legs. Anyway, I thought you two were all upset that Trelawney had gone?」
Lavender:「We are! We went up to her office to see her, we took her some daffodils — not the honking ones that Sprout’s got, nice ones . . .」
Harry:「How is she?」
Lavender:「Not very good, poor thing. She was crying and saying she’d rather leave the castle forever than stay here if Umbridge is still here, and I don’t blame her. Umbridge was horrible to her, wasn’t she?」
Hermione:「I’ve got a feeling Umbridge has only just started being horrible.」
