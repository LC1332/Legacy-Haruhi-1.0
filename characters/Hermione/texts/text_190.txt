Ron:「Er — what?」
Unknown girl:「’Ogwarts.」
Hermione:「Beauxbatons.」
Harry:「Sorry?」
Hermione:「They must go to Beauxbatons. You know . . . Beauxbatons Academy of Magic . . . I read about it in An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe.」
Ron:「You’re kidding!」
Hermione:「Maybe it’s back in the tent.」
:Harry usually kept his wand with him at all times in the Wizarding world, and finding himself without it in the midst of a scene like this made him feel very vulnerable.
Winky:「There is bad wizards about! People high — high in the air! Winky is getting out of the way!」
Ron:「What’s up with her? Why can’t she run properly?」
Hermione:「Bet she didn’t ask permission to hide.」
