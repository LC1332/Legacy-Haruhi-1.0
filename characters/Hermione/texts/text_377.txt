Harry:「Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that?」
Hermione:「Umbridge is shorter than that woman, and anyway, even if Umbridge does come in here there’s nothing she can do to stop us, Harry, because I’ve double- and triple-checked the school rules. We’re not out-of-bounds; I specifically asked Professor Flitwick whether students were allowed to come in the Hog’s Head, and he said yes, but he advised me strongly to bring our own glasses. And I’ve looked up everything I can think of about study groups and homework groups and they’re definitely allowed. I just don’t think it’s a good idea if we parade what we’re doing.」
Harry:「No, especially as it’s not exactly a homework group you’re planning, is it?」

Barman:「What?」
Hermione:「Three butterbeers, please,」
