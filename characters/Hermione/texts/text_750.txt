Harry:「Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. “I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?” “Yes,” said Harry. “Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand. Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, “So. We begin!”」
Narrator:Griphook think "I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once, on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected. . . ."
Hermione:「There’s really only enough left for one of us.」
