Harry:「Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was inside her. You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I’d go back.」
Hermione:「The snake was inside her?」
Harry:「Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined, She didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . . and then . . .」
Harry:「she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.」
Harry:「It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came.」
Harry:「Sick at heart, he sat up and threw back the covers.」
Hermione:「Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!」
