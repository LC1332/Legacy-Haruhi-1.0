Ron:「What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?」
Narrator:Harry think "The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking. . . ."
Hermione:「Harry? Are you still with us?」
Harry:「Wha — ? Yeah, of course. Well . . . okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll take some Felix and have another go this evening.」
Hermione:「That’s decided, then. Destination . . . determination . . . deliberation . . .」
Ron:「Cool. Blimey, they don’t look happy, do they?」
Hermione:「They’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they don’t look happy, didn’t you hear what happened to their little brother?」
