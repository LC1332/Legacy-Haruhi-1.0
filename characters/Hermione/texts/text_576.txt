Harry:「Ron’s dad and Lupin think so. But this definitely proves Malfoy’s planning something, you can’t deny that.」
Hermione:「No, I can’t.」
Harry:「And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I said!」
Hermione:「Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention Voldemort’s name?」
:Harry told her all about Lupin’s mission among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing
Hermione:「Have you heard of this Fenrir Greyback?」
Harry:「No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin with him! Back in Knockturn Alley, don’t you remember? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress!」
Harry:「I forgot! But this proves Malfoy’s a Death Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do?」
Hermione:「It is pretty suspicious. Unless . . .」
