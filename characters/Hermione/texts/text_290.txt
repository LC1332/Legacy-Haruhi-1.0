Ron:「I hate being poor.」
Hermione:「It’s rubbish.」
Ron:「I don’t blame Fred and George for trying to make some extra money. Wish I could. Wish I had a niffler.」
Hermione:「Well, we know what to get you next Christmas.」
Hermione:「Well, Rita’s definitely not using an Invisibility Cloak! Moody says he didn’t see her anywhere near the judges’ table at the second task, or anywhere near the lake!」
Harry:「Maybe she had you bugged.」
Ron:「Bugged? What . . . put fleas on her or something?」
Hermione:「Aren’t you two ever going to read Hogwarts: A History?」
Ron:「Haven’t we got enough to worry about? Do we have to start a vendetta against Rita Skeeter as well?」
Hermione:「I’m not asking you to help! I’ll do it on my own!」
