Hermione:「Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice, just like all the purebloods who treat them like animals . . . It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn’t.」
Kreacher:「The house-elf’s highest law is his Master’s bidding. Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home. . . .」
Hermione:「Well, then, you did what you were told, didn’t you? You didn’t disobey orders at all!」
