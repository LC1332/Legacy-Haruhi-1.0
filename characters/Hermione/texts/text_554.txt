Harry:「If he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?」
Hermione:「The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough pure-blood wizards left. I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.」
