Sirius:「Just for a few seconds to check if the coast was clear yet」
Hermione:「But what if you’d been seen?」
Sirius:「Well, I think a girl — first year by the look of her — might’ve got a glimpse of me earlier, but don’t worry, I was gone the moment she looked back at me and I’ll bet she just thought I was an oddly shaped log or something」
Hermione:「But Sirius, this is taking an awful risk —」
Harry:「I forgot, Don’t look at me like that, Hermione, there was no way anyone would have got secret information out of it, was there, Sirius?」
Sirius:「No, it was very good, Anyway, we’d better be quick, just in case we’re disturbed — your scar」
Ron:「What about — ?」
Hermione:「We’ll tell you afterward, go on, Sirius」
