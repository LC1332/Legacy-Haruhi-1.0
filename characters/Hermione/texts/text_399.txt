Harry:「Good, because we’ve found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting. Tonight, eight o’clock, seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls. Can you tell Katie and Alicia?」
Hermione:「Well . . . it’s just that Dobby’s plans aren’t always that safe. Don’t you remember when he lost you all the bones in your arm?」
Harry:「This room isn’t just some mad idea of Dobby’s; Dumbledore knows about it too, he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball.」
Hermione:「Dumbledore told you about it?」
Harry:「Hold it,」
Harry:「I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.」
Harry:「Filch is on the second floor, and Mrs. Norris is on the fourth.」
Hermione:「And Umbridge?」
Harry:「Okay,」
Harry:「Dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three times, concentrating hard on what we need.」
Harry:「We need somewhere to learn to fight. . . . Just give us a place to practice . . . somewhere they can’t find us . . .」
Hermione:「Harry,」
