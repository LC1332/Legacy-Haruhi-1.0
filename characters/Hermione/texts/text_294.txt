George:「Well, stop telling people what to do then. See you later」
:Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at one another
Hermione:「You don’t think they know something about all this, do you? About Crouch and everything?」
Harry:「No, if it was something that serious, they’d tell someone. They’d tell Dumbledore」
:Ron looking uncomfortable
Ron:「It’s this joke shop idea they’ve got. They want to start one. They’ve only got a year left at Hogwarts, they keep going on about how it’s time to think about their future, and Dad can’t help them, and they need gold to get started」
Hermione:「Yes, but they wouldn’t do anything against the law to get gold」
Ron:「Are you mad? Tell Percy? He’d probably do a Crouch and turn them in. Come on, let’s get some breakfast」
Hermione:「D’you think it’s too early to go and see Professor Moody?」
