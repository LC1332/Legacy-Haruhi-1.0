Ron:「It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit.」
Hermione:「Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there for Christmas.」
Ron:「I wasn’t at the Burrow! Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would’ve been great about it. And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.」
Hermione:「But where have you been, then?」
Hermione:「Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?」
Hermione:「It’s nothing like a bird. I was talking about a chess rook. A castle to you.」
