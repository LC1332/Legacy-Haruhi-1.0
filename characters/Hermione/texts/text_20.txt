Harry:「I’ve found him! I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel’!」
Hermione:「Stay there!」
:Hermione whispered excitedly
Harry:「The what?」
Hermione:「Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look — read that, there.」
Ron:「And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. He’s not exactly recent if he’s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?」
Harry:「It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.」
Hermione:「Ron! Harry!」
