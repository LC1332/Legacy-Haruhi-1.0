Hagrid:「Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come in, come in — thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again —」
:Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin
:Hagrid cheerful
Hermione:「I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it to stop, That’s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand —」
:Hagrid bustling around making them tea
Harry:「What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?」
Hagrid:「Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well, Like I don’ know. An’ bangin’ on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I’ll eat my kettle.」
Hagrid:「It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts teacher,」
Harry:「looked at him in surprise.」
Hermione:「I think you’re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job —」
