Hermione:「Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did, but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?」
Harry:「Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really happened!」
Ron:「Drop it. It’s up to him. And if we’re going to the Ministry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we should go over the plan?」
Hermione:「Robes. Polyjuice Potion. Invisibility Cloak. Decoy Detonators. You should each take a couple just in case. Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable Ears.」

Hermione:「You simply can’t go to work like this!」
