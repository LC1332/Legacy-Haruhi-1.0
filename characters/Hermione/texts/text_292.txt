Karkaroff:「What is this? What’s going on?」
Hermione:「It comes down to this, Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn’t looking.」
Ron:「That’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He’d done a runner.」
Harry:「He seemed really weak — I don’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything.」
Hermione:「You can’t Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven’t I told you enough times?」
Harry:「He said he wanted to warn Dumbledore about something. He definitely mentioned Bertha Jorkins, and he seemed to think she was dead. He kept saying stuff was his fault. . . . He mentioned his son.」
Hermione:「Well, that was his fault.」
