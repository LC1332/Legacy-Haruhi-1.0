Harry:「Did you hear me right?」
Hermione:「Of course I did. You want to go to Godric’s Hollow. I agree, I think we should. I mean, I can’t think of anywhere else it could be either. It’ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more likely it seems it’s there.」
Harry:「Er — what’s there?」
Hermione:「Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d want to go back there, and I mean, Godric’s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor’s birthplace —」
Harry:「Erm, I might’ve opened it, you know, when I bought it . . . just the once. . . .」
Hermione:「Well, as the village is named after him I’d have thought you might have made the connection. There’s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . .」
Harry:「“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.」
Hermione:「“Who?”」
