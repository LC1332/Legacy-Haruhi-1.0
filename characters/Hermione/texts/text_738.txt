Harry:「Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!」
Hermione:「Harry, you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story —」
Harry:「Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!」
Hermione:「A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!」
Narrator:Harry think "Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died! My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow. . . . He’s my ancestor! I’m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!"
Hermione:「Harry」
