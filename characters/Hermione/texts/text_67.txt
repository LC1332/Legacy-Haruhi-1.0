Myrtle:「“I wish people would stop talking behind my back!” said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. “I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead —”」
Hermione:「“Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,” said Hermione. “Harry only —”」
Myrtle:「“No one wants to upset me! That’s a good one!” howled Myrtle. “My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!”」
Hermione:「We wanted to ask you if you’ve seen anything funny lately, Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.」
Ron:「Already dead.」
:Myrtle rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend
Hermione:「Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle. . . . Come on, let’s go.」
