Neville:「it’s-his-problem-not-yours looks」
Hermione:「What’s the matter? You look absolutely — oh for heaven’s sake.」
Hermione:「They are the limit」
Hermione:「Because we’re prefects! It’s up to us to stop this kind of thing!」
Hermione:「Yes, Lavender thinks so too」
Hermione:「Don’t you remember what Dumbledore said at the end-of-term feast last year? About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust —’」
Hermione:「The point is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who’s only been back two months, and we’ve started fighting among ourselves. And the Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand together, be united —」
Harry:「Yeah, we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that」
Harry:「Dumbledore didn’t even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman’s staying,」
Hermione:「Maybe . . .」
