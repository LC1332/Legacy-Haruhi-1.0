Harry:「It is true? Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?」
Hermione:「I don’t know, Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there’s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.」
Ron:「It’ll be one of those goblin stories, about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.」
Hermione:「Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron, They’ve been treated brutally in the past.」
Ron:「Okay, how’s this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault, and then he can have it. There’s a fake in there, isn’t there? We switch them, and give him the fake.」
Hermione:「Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would! He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!」
Ron:「All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What’s your solution, then?」
Hermione:「We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.」
Hermione:「Does it make a difference?」
