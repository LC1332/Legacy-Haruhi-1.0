Harry:「Maybe she’s got an Invisibility Cloak, Sort of thing she’d do, isn’t it, hide in bushes listening to people.」
Hermione:「Like you and Ron did, you mean.」
Ron:「We weren’t trying to hear him! We didn’t have any choice! The stupid prat, talking about his giantess mother where anyone could have heard him!」
Harry:「We’ve got to go and see him, This evening, after Divination. Tell him we want him back . . . you do want him back?」
Hermione:「I — well, I’m not going to pretend it didn’t make a nice change, having a proper Care of Magical Creatures lesson for once — but I do want Hagrid back, of course I do!」
Hermione:「I just thought you’d want to take advantage of the common room being quiet, Really get to work on that egg.」
Harry:「He’s mad! It must be freezing, it’s January!」
Hermione:「It’s a lot colder where he comes from, I suppose it feels quite warm to him.」
