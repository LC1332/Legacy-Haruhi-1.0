Harry:「Unless you get out now.」
Hermione:「What has been going on?」
Narrator:Ron think "I think he’s been knocked out. No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep."
Harry:「You’ve met Malfoy before?」
Narrator:Harry think "He explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley."
Ron:「I’ve heard of his family, They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.」
Ron:「Can we help you with something?」
Hermione:「You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there. You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we even get there!」
