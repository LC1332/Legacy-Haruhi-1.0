Harry:「But he says it’s all important and it’ll help me survive.」
Hermione:「I think it’s fascinating」
Hermione:「It makes absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How else will you find out his weaknesses?」
Ron:「The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?」
Hermione:「That’s right. Personally, I thought she was a bit full of herself, but —」
Hermione:「No, we shouldn’t!」
Hermione:「Pass me a bowl」
Harry:「groaned」
Ron:「And this is another party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?」
Hermione:「Just for the Slug Club, yes.」
Ron:「‘Slug Club.’ It’s pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don’t you try hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug —」
Hermione:「We’re allowed to bring guests, and I was going to ask you to come, but if you think it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!」
