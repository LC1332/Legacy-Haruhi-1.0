Harry:「I think we should do it tomorrow.」
Hermione:「Tomorrow? You aren’t serious, Harry?」
Harry:「I am, I don’t think we’re going to be much better prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther away that locket could be. There’s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t open.」
Ron:「Unless, she’s found a way of opening it and she’s now possessed.」
Harry:「Wouldn’t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,」
:Hermione biting her lip, deep in thought.
Harry:「Exactly, And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend —」
Hermione:「But we haven’t got any!」
Harry:「That’ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing, It’s time to act.」
:Ron scared
:Hermione scared
Hermione:「Oh, don’t start that again! I thought we’d settled this.」
