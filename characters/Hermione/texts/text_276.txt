Ron:「I don’t reckon it can be done, There’s nothing. Nothing. Closest was that thing to dry up puddles and ponds, that Drought Charm, but that was nowhere near powerful enough to drain the lake.」
Hermione:「There must be something, They’d never have set a task that was undoable.」
Ron:「Harry, just go down to the lake tomorrow, right, stick your head in, yell at the merpeople to give back whatever they’ve nicked, and see if they chuck it out. Best you can do, mate.」
Hermione:「There’s a way of doing it! There just has to be!」
