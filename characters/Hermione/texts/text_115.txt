Ron:「By the sound of it — everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wizarding equipment shop, Zonko’s Joke Shop, into the Three Broomsticks for foaming mugs of hot butterbeer, and many places besides.」
Hermione:「The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on shelves, all color-coded depending on how fast you want your letter to get there!」
Ron:「Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out free samples, there’s a bit, look —」
Ron:「We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the Three Broomsticks —」
Ron:「Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms you up —」
Hermione:「What did you do? Did you get any work done?」
Hermione:「We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be starting in five minutes. . . .」
