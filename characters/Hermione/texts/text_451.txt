Harry:「I wasn’t the sole witness, There were a dozen-odd Death Eaters there as well. Want their names?」
Rita:「I’d love them, A great bold headline: ‘Potter Accuses . . .’ A subheading: ‘Harry Potter Names Death Eaters Still Among Us.’ And then, beneath a nice big photograph of you: ‘Disturbed teenage survivor of You-Know-Who’s attack, Harry Potter, 15, caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent members of the Wizarding community of being Death Eaters . . .’」
Rita:「But of course, Little Miss Perfect wouldn’t want that story out there, would she?」
Hermione:「As a matter of fact, that’s exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want.」
Rita:「You want me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?」
Hermione:「Yes, I do, The true story. All the facts. Exactly as Harry reports them. He’ll give you all the details, he’ll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there, he’ll tell you what Voldemort looks like now — oh, get a grip on yourself,」
Hermione:「There’s no market for a story like that.」
