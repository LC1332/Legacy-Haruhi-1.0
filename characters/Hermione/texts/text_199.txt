Mrs. Weasley:「If I’d seen that, I’d have known you were alive!」
Hermione:「Why were you asking if Hedwig had come, Harry? Are you expecting a letter?」
Harry:「I told Sirius about my scar, I’m waiting for his answer.」
Ron:「Good thinking! I bet Sirius’ll know what to do!」
Harry:「I hoped he’d get back to me quickly.」
Hermione:「But we don’t know where Sirius is . . . he could be in Africa or somewhere, couldn’t he? Hedwig’s not going to manage that journey in a few days.」
Hermione:「Harry doesn’t want to play Quidditch right now. He’s worried, and he’s tired. We all need to go to bed.」
