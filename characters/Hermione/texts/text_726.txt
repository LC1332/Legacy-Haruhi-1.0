Xenophilius:「Alas, who knows? Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.」
Hermione:「Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly Hallows?」
Xenophilius:「Peverell . . . he had heard that name before. . . .」
Xenophilius:「But you have been misleading me, young woman! I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything — everything! — to do with the Hallows!」
Hermione:「Who are the Peverells?」
