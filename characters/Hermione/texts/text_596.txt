Harry:「Good one. How’d you do, Hermione?」
Narrator:Ron think "Oh, she was perfect, obviously. Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross going on about her — I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t pop the question soon —"
Hermione:「And what about you? Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?」
Harry:「Yep. And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!」
Ron:「Tonks?」
Hermione:「Tonks?」
Harry:「I had a thought, You don’t think she can have been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius?」
Hermione:「What on earth makes you say that?」
Ron:「Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it? She’s gone a bit funny. Lost her nerve. Women, they’re easily upset.」
Hermione:「And yet, I doubt you’d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didn’t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and the Mimbulus mimbletonia.」
