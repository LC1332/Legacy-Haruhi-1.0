Ron:「Anyone we know dead?」
Hermione:「No, but there have been more dementor attacks, And an arrest」
Harry:「Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater? No way!」
Ron:「He might have been put under the Imperius Curse, You never can tell」
Hermione:「It doesn’t look like it, It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters’ secret plans in a pub」
Hermione:「They probably want to look as though they’re doing something, People are terrified — you know the Patil twins’ parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night」
:Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster’s chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago
Hermione:「I think he’s left the school to do something with the Order, I mean . . . it’s all looking serious, isn’t it?」
