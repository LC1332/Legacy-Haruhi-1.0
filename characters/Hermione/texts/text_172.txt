Harry:「I’m going to grab the Cloak!」
Hermione:「Harry, no!」
Hermione:「See? See what would have happened? We’ve got to keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak!」
Hermione:「Harry, there’s something I don’t understand. . . . Why didn’t the dementors get Sirius? I remember them coming, and then I think I passed out . . . there were so many of them. . . .」
Harry:「There’s only one thing it could have been, to make the dementors go. A real Patronus. A powerful one.」
Hermione:「But who conjured it?」
Harry:「Yeah, I saw him. But . . . maybe I imagined it. . . . I wasn’t thinking straight. . . . I passed out right afterward. . . .」
Hermione:「Who did you think it was?」
Harry:「I know that.」
Hermione:「You think you saw his ghost?」
Hermione:「I know it sounds crazy.」
