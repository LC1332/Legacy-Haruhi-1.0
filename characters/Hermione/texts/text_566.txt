Harry:「Party up in the common room, Seamus said! C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!」
Hermione:「I want a word with you, Harry. You shouldn’t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it’s illegal.」
Ron:「What are you going to do, turn us in?」
Hermione:「You know perfectly well what we’re talking about! You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast! Felix Felicis!」
Harry:「I didn’t put it in! I wanted Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were looking. You saved everything because you felt lucky. You did it all yourself.」
Ron:「There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice? But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play. . . . I honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?」
Harry:「You added Felix Felicis to Ron’s juice this morning, that’s why he saved everything! See! I can save goals without help, Hermione!」
Hermione:「I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d been given it too!」
