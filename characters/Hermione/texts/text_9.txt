Hermione:「I — told — you.」
Ron:「We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower, quickly as possible.」
Hermione:「Malfoy tricked you. You realize that, don’t you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.」
Hermione:「Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.」
Narrator:Peeves think "STUDENTS OUT OF BED! STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!"
Hermione:「Oh, move over.」
