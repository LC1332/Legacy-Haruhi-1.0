Ron:「How come all the spells bounced off him?」
Hermione:「It’ll be his giant blood, It’s very hard to Stun a giant, they’re like trolls, really tough. . . . But poor Professor McGonagall. . . . Four Stunners straight in the chest, and she’s not exactly young, is she?」
Ernie:「Dreadful, dreadful, Well, I’m off to bed . . . ’Night, all . . .」
Ron:「At least they didn’t get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban, I ’spect he’s gone to join Dumbledore, hasn’t he?」
Hermione:「Oh, this is awful, I really thought Dumbledore would be back before long, but now we’ve lost Hagrid too . . .」
Hermione:「Umbridge hates part-humans, She was always going to try and get Hagrid out.」
