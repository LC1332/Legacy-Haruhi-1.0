Ron:「Well, it’s not much use to you. Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle’s nose.」
Hermione:「Oooh, it might have hidden powers.」
Ron:「Maybe it’s shy. I don’t know why you don’t chuck it, Harry.」
Harry:「I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it. I wouldn’t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.」
Hermione:「But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione’s face that she was thinking what he was thinking.」
Ron:「Yeah . . .」
Hermione:「And this diary is fifty years old. So? Oh, Ron, wake up. We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything — where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it — the person who’s behind the attacks this time wouldn’t want that lying around, would they?」
