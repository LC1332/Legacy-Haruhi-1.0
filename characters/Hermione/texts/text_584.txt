Fred:「Wood might’ve done the Slytherins if he could’ve got away with it.」
Hermione:「Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a connection between the attacks.」
Fred:「How d’you work that out?」
Hermione:「Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and weren’t, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed. Of course, that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, because they don’t seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim.」
Mr. Weasley:「Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it. Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.」
Hagrid:「It’s terrible. All this new security, an’ kids are still gettin’ hurt. . . . Dumbledore’s worried sick. . . . He don’ say much, but I can tell. . . .」
Hermione:「Hasn’t he got any ideas, Hagrid?」
