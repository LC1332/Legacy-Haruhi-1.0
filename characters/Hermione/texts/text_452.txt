Luna:「No, he’s the editor of The Quibbler.」
Rita:「‘Important stories he thinks the public needs to know’? I could manure my garden with the contents of that rag.」
Hermione:「Well, this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit, isn’t it? Luna says her father’s quite happy to take Harry’s interview. That’s who’ll be publishing it.」
Rita:「whoop of laughter.」
Hermione:「The Quibbler! You think people will take him seriously if he’s published in The Quibbler?」
Luna:「I don’t think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine. They do it because it’s an honor, and, of course, to see their names in print.」
Rita:「Rita Skeeter looked as though the taste of Stinksap was strong in her mouth again as she rounded on Hermione. “I’m supposed to do this for free?”」
Hermione:「Well, yes. Otherwise, as you very well know, I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus. Of course, the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider’s account of life in Azkaban . . .」
