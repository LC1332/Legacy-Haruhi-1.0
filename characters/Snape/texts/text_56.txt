Harry:「How do you know? Is this just Professor Dumbledore guessing, or — ?」
Snape:「I told you, to call me ‘sir.’」
Harry:「Yes, sir, but how do you know — ?」
Snape:「It is enough that we know. The important point is that the Dark Lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thoughts and feelings.

Harry:「He felt a sharp pain in his knee. Snape’s office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor; one of his knees had collided painfully with the leg of Snape’s desk. He looked up at Snape, who had lowered his wand and was rubbing his wrist. There was an angry weal there, like a scorch mark.」
Snape:「Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex?」
