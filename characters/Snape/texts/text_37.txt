Filch:「Filch? What’s going on?」
Snape:「It’s Peeves, Professor, He threw this egg down the stairs.」
Snape:「Peeves couldn’t get into my office. . . .」
Snape:「I seal my office with a spell none but a wizard could break!」
Snape:「Stopped talking very abruptly.」
Moody:「Pajama party, is it?」
Filch:「Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor. Peeves the Poltergeist, throwing things around as usual — and then Professor Snape discovered that someone had broken into his off —」
Snape:「It is unimportant.」
Moody:「Reckon they were after potion ingredients, eh? Not hiding anything else in your office, are you?」
Snape:「You know I’m hiding nothing, Moody, as you’ve searched my office pretty thoroughly yourself.」
