Narrator:Dumbledore think "That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a time — after my death — do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to fear for the life of his snake."
Snape:「For Nagini?」
Narrator:Dumbledore think "Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry."
Snape:「Tell him what?」
Snape:「And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.」
Snape:「Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?」
Dumbledore:「Meaning?」
Snape:「I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter —」
Dumbledore:「After all this time?」
Snape:「Always.」
