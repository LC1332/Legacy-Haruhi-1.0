Snape:「I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow, Very useful, Potter, I thank you. . . .」
Snape:「You’re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here? I’ve just been to your office, Lupin. You forgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And very lucky I did . . . lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was a certain map. One glance at it told me all I needed to know. I saw you running along this passageway and out of sight.」
Lupin:「Severus, you’re making a mistake, You haven’t heard everything — I can explain — Sirius is not here to kill Harry —」
Snape:「Two more for Azkaban tonight, I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this. . . . He was quite convinced you were harmless, you know, Lupin . . . a tame werewolf —」
Snape:「Give me a reason, Give me a reason to do it, and I swear I will.」
