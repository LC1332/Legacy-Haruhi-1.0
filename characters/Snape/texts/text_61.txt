Snape:「“You do know why we are here, don’t you, Potter? You do know why I am giving up my evenings to this tedious job?”」
Harry:「“So I can learn Occlumency.”」
Snape:「“Correct, Potter. And dim though you may be, I would have thought that after two months’ worth of lessons you might have made some progress. How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had?”」
Harry:「“No, they don’t.”」
Snape:「“That is just as well, Potter, because you are neither special nor important, and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters.”」
