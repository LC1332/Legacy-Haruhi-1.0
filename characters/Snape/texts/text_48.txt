Snape:「Potter, what is this supposed to be?」
Snape:「Tell me, Potter, can you read?」
Harry:「Read the third line of the instructions for me, Potter.」
Harry:「“‘Add powdered moonstone, stir three times counterclockwise, allow to simmer for seven minutes, then add two drops of syrup of hellebore.’”」
Harry:「“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?”」

Harry:「“No,” said Harry, more loudly. “I forgot the hellebore . . .”」
Snape:「“I know you did, Potter, which means that this mess is utterly worthless. Evanesco.”」
