Voldemort:「As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest, At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.」
Yaxley:「We are at an advantage there, my Lord, We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.」
Snape:「He will not do either, The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.」
