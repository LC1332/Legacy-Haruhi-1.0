Harry:「What did Malfoy mean? Why would I want revenge on Black? He hasn’t done anything to me — yet.」
Ron:「He’s making it up. He’s trying to make you do something stupid. . . .」
Snape:「Everyone gather ’round, and watch what happens to Longbottom’s toad. If he has managed to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I don’t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poisoned.」
Snape:「Five points from Gryffindor. I told you not to help him, Miss Granger. Class dismissed.」
