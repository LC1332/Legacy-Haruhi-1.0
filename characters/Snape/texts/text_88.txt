Voldemort:「Saturday . . . at nightfall,」
Snape:「— from the source we discussed,」
Yaxley:「My Lord, I have heard differently.」
Snape:「My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.」
Squat man:「The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?」
Voldemort:「Where are they going to hide the boy next?」
Snape:「At the home of one of the Order, The place, according to the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest.」
