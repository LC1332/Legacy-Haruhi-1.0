Narcissa:「That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store! Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance for Lucius’s mistake, I know it!」
Snape:「That’s why he’s chosen Draco, isn’t it? To punish Lucius?」
Snape:「If Draco succeeds, he will be honored above all others.」
Narcissa:「Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge! He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be killed trying!」
Snape:「He intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, fulfilling my useful role as spy.」
Narcissa:「My only son . . . my only son . . .」
Bellatrix:「You should be proud! If I had sons, I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord!」
Narcissa:「Severus — oh, Severus — you would help him? Would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?」
Snape:「I can try.」
