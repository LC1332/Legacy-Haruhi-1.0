Filch:「Rubbish! He saw my Kwikspell letter!」
Snape:「If I might speak, Headmaster. Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn’t he at the Halloween feast?」
Harry:「Because we were tired and wanted to go to bed. Without any supper? We weren’t hungry.」
:Ronstomach gave a huge rumble
Snape:「I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful. It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.」
