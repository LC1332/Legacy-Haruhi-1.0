Harry:「Did you see everything I saw?」
Snape:「Flashes of it. To whom did the dog belong?」
Harry:「My Aunt Marge.」
Snape:「Well, for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been. You managed to stop me eventually, though you wasted time and energy shouting. You must remain focused. Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand.」
Harry:「Clear your mind, Potter. Let go of all emotion . . .」
Harry:「You’re not doing it, Potter. You will need more discipline than this. Focus, now . . .」
Harry:「Let’s go again . . . on the count of three . . . one — two — three — Legilimens!」
Harry:「NOOOOOOO!」
Harry:「Get up! Get up! You are not trying, you are making no effort, you are allowing me access to memories you fear, handing me weapons!」
Harry:「I — am — making — an — effort.」
Snape:「I told you to empty yourself of emotion!」
