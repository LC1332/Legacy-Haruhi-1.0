Hermione:「Good afternoon.」
Snape:「You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this. Hanging around like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?」
Snape:「Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.」
