Harry:「Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin, I —」
Snape:「This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we’ll make it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.」
Harry:「Where’s Professor Lupin?」

Snape:「Miss Granger, I was under the impression that I am teaching this lesson, not you. And I am telling you all to turn to page 394. All of you! Now!」
Snape:「That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.」
