Harry:「Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but Inferi are dead bodies, aren’t they? So they’d be solid —」
Snape:「A five-year-old could have told us as much, The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizard’s spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard’s bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now, is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth . . . and of course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent.」
Ron:「Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to tell them apart! When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley, we’re going to be having a shufti to see if it’s solid, aren’t we, we’re not going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you the imprint of a departed soul?’」
Snape:「Another ten points from Gryffindor, I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.」
