:Snapepacing up and down in front of Dumbledore
Snape:「— mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and impertinent —」
Dumbledore:「You see what you expect to see, Severus. Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.」
Dumbledore:「Keep an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?」
Snape:「Karkaroff’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.」
Snape:「No. I am not such a coward.」
