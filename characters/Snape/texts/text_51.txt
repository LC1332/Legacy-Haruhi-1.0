Harry:「announces his presence」
Snape:「looks at Harry and tells him to sit down」
Sirius:「loudly says he prefers if Snape doesn't give orders in his house」
Snape:「flushes and tells Harry he was supposed to see him alone」
Sirius:「What’s that supposed to mean?」
Snape:「Merely that I am sure you must feel — ah — frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful, for the Order.」
Harry:「Study what?」
Snape:「Occlumency, Potter. The magical defense of the mind against external penetration. An obscure branch of magic, but a highly useful one.」
Harry:「Who’s going to be teaching me?」
Snape:「I am.」
Sirius:「If I hear you’re using these Occlumency lessons to give Harry a hard time, you’ll have me to answer to.」
Snape:「How touching. But surely you have noticed that Potter is very like his father?」
