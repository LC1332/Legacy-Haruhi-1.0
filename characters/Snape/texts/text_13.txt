Lockhart:「The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment, Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming.」
Snape:「“Just the man,” he said. “The very man. A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself. Your moment has come at last.”」
Professor Sprout:「“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chipped in Professor Sprout. “Weren’t you saying just last night that you’ve known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?”」
Lockhart:「“I — well, I —” sputtered Lockhart.」
Professor Flitwick:「Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside it?」
Professor Flitwick:「D-did I? I don’t recall —」
Snape:「I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn’t had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested. Didn’t you say that the whole affair had been bungled, and that you should have been given a free rein from the first?」
