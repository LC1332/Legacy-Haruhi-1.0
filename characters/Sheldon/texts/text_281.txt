Leonard:「You just got him this afternoon.」
Raj:「Yes, but I'm finding that having a lackey suits me.」
Leonard:「A lackey?」
Raj:「Oh, I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables.」
Sheldon:「Now?」
Leonard:「Almost.」
Raj:「Speaking of untouchables, I’ve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.」
Howard:「Oh, gee, thanks.」
Raj:「Oh, you're welcome. Of course, I couldn't get you into the VIP section, because, you know, that's for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps.」
Sheldon:「There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. (Smiles)」
