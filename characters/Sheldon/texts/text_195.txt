'''Scene''':「''Sheldon’s bedroom.''」
Leonard:「Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?」
Sheldon:「Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. It's noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence.」
Leonard:「That's fascinating, but I...」
Sheldon:「I didn't say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy.」
Leonard:「Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and Wolowitz... they're hitting on your sister.」
Sheldon:「Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want to criticise your rhetorical style but, we'd be a lot further along in this conversation if you'd begun with that thought.」
Leonard:「That's great, but I....」
Sheldon:「What I'm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.」
Leonard:「Whatever. You have to do something about it.」
Sheldon:「Why?」
Leonard:「Because she's your sister.」
Sheldon:「I don't understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then we’ve pretty much gone our own separate ways.」
Leonard:「Okay, uh.... oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate.」
Sheldon:「I hadn't considered that. We do share DNA.」
Leonard:「Uh-huh.」
Sheldon:「So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself.」
Leonard:「Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sister's future offspring.」
Sheldon:「You're right. If someone wants to get at Missy's fallopian tubes, they'll have to go through me.」
