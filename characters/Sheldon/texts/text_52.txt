Mary Cooper:「''(Entering)'' Good morning, snicker-doodle.」
Sheldon:「Morning.」
Mary Cooper:「Oh, well that looks awful fancy, what is that?」
Sheldon:「It's my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form.」
Mary Cooper:「But intelligently designed by a creator, right?」
Sheldon:「What do you want, mom?」
Mary Cooper:「You know how your daddy used to say that you can only fish for so long before you got to throw a stick of dynamite in the water?」
Sheldon:「Yeah.」
Mary Cooper:「Well, I'm done fishing. ''(Throwing a pair of trousers on the bed)'' You put those on.」
Sheldon:「What for?」
Mary Cooper:「Because you're going to go down to your office, you're going to apologize to your boss, and get your job back.」
Sheldon:「No.」
Mary Cooper:「I'm sorry, did I start that sentence with the words “if it please your highness?”」
Sheldon:「I'm not going to apologize, I didn't say anything that wasn't true.」
Mary Cooper:「Now you listen here, I have been telling you since you were four years old, it's okay to be smarter than everybody but you can't go around pointing it out.」
Sheldon:「Why not?」
Mary Cooper:「Because people don't like it. Remember all the ass-kickings you got from the neighbour kids? Now let's get cracking. Shower, shirt, shoes, and let's shove off. ''(Exits)''」
Sheldon:「Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.」
