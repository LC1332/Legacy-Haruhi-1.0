Third Floor Janitor:「The answer is minus eight by alpha.」
Sheldon:「Hang on, hang on a second, that's not our answer. What are you doing?」
Third Floor Janitor:「Answering question. Winning physics bowl.」
Sheldon:「How do you know anything about physics?」
Third Floor Janitor:「Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Polytechnica. Go Polar Bears.」
Sheldon:「Well that's a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions.」
Third Floor Janitor:「You didn't answer question.」
Sheldon:「Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. ''(Makes fist in the air)''. Ow!」
Gablehouser:「AA, I need your official answer.」
Sheldon:「Well it's not what he said.」
Gablehouser:「Then what is it?」
Sheldon:「I want a different question.」
Gablehouser:「You can't have a different question.」
Sheldon:「Formal protest.」
Gablehouser:「Denied.」
Sheldon:「Informal protest.」
Gablehouser:「Denied. I need your official answer.」
Sheldon:「No. I decline to provide one.」
Gablehouser:「Well, that's too bad, because the answer your teammate gave was correct.」
Sheldon:「That's your opinion.」
Gablehouser:「Alright, the winner of the match is...」
Leonard:「Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team.」
Sheldon:「I don't understand the question.」
