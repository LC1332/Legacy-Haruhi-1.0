'''Scene''':「''[[The Cheesecake Factory]]''」
Penny:「Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and that's served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the day...」
Sheldon:「''(Appearing behind her)'' You must release me from my oath.」
Penny:「Sheldon, I'm working.」
Sheldon:「Why don't you take a minute to decide ''(leads her away)'' I can't keep your secret Penny. I'm going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.」
Penny:「Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?」
Sheldon:「I'm constitutionally incapable. That's why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me.」
Penny:「Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?」
Sheldon:「Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I haven't forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.」
