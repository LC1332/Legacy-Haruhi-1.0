Penny:「Uh, so Christy, what are your plans?」
Christy:「Oh, well, Howard said he'd take me shopping in Beverley Hills.」
Penny:「Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I don't love having you, but it's... a little crowded.」
Leonard:「Penny, you're always welcome to stay with us.」
Sheldon:「Oh, terrific, now we’re running a cute little B&B.」
Howard:「Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesn't Christy stay with me?」
Leonard:「For one thing you live with your mother.」
Howard:「I do not, my mother lives with me.」
Sheldon:「Well then, it's all settled, Christy will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and I'll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point it's more like Doctor Why Bother.」
Leonard:「Sheldon you just can't dictate...」
Sheldon:「No more talking, everybody go!」
