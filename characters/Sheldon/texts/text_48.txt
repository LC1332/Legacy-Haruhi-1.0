Sheldon:「That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores.」
Penny:「Oh, I don't know Sheldon, it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today.」
Sheldon:「Are you sure? There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month's supply at a time.」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「Well think about it, it's a product that doesn't spoil, and you're going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years.」
Penny:「You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?」
Sheldon:「Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?」
Penny:「Okay, I'm not talking about this with you.」
Sheldon:「Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and we’re talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28-day cycle, are you fairly regular? ''(Penny shuts door in his face.)'' Okay, no warehouse store, but we’re still on for put-put golf, right?」
