'''Scene''':「''The living room of the apartment.''」
Penny:「''(To Raj)'' Mmm, this is really delicious, isn't it? ''(Raj looks uncomfortable, then nods.)'' Still can't talk to me unless you're drunk, huh? ''(Shakes head)'' Oh, sweetie, you are so damaged.」
Howard:「Hey, I'm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie?」
Penny:「Sure. Raj, hug Howard.」
Sheldon:「''(Dramatically)'' Uh-uh-uh.」
Leonard:「Something you'd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.」
Sheldon:「Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and he's already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to... you know, that other guy.」
Howard:「Antonio Salieri?」
Sheldon:「Oh, God, now even you're smarter than me.」
Howard:「You know, Sheldon, you don't have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them.」
Leonard:「Just eat, Sheldon, you'll feel better.」
Sheldon:「Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they don't keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes.」
Penny:「I'm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?」
Leonard:「You can't let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg.」
Penny:「So, you've got a bit of competition, I really don't see what the big deal is.」
Sheldon:「Well of course you don't, you've never excelled at anything.」
Penny:「I don't understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place?」
Howard:「We liked Leonard.」
Leonard:「Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?」
Sheldon:「Yes. That's what a rational person does when his entire life's work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die.」
