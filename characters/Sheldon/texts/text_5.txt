Leonard:「Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building.」
Penny:「Thank you, maybe we can have coffee sometime.」
Leonard:「Oh, great.」
Penny:「Great.」
Sheldon:「Great.」
Leonard:「Great. Well, bye.」
Penny:「Bye.」
Sheldon:「Bye.」
Leonard:「Bye.」
Leonard:「Should we have invited her for lunch?」
Sheldon:「No. We’re going to start Season Two of "[[Battlestar Galactica]]".」
Leonard:「We already watched the Season Two DVDs.」
Sheldon:「Not with commentary.」
Leonard:「I think we should be good neighbors, invite her over, make her feel welcome.」
Sheldon:「We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.」
Leonard:「Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle.」
Sheldon:「I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on Myspace.」
Leonard:「Yes, and you've never met one of them.」
Sheldon:「That's the beauty of it.」
Leonard:「I'm going to invite her over. We'll have a nice meal and chat.」
Sheldon:「Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.」
Leonard:「Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says, and then you say something appropriate in response.」
Sheldon:「To what end?」
Leonard:「Hi. Again.」
Penny:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Penny:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.」
