Leonard:「What are you talking about?」
Dennis:「That.」
Sheldon:「He's not wrong. Alright, and this is my office.」
Dennis:「Is this part of the tour?」
Sheldon:「Nope. Goodbye.」
Leonard:「Come on, Sheldon, we’ve hardly shown him anything.」
Sheldon:「Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.」
Dennis:「Looks like you're doing work in quantum loop corrections.」
Sheldon:「Keen observation, goodbye.」
Dennis:「You see where you went wrong, don't you?」
Sheldon:「Leonard.」
Leonard:「Huh, yeah?」
Sheldon:「Get him out.」
