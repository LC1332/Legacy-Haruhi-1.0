'''Scene''':「Penny's flat. Penny is on her laptop. Everything around her is littered with empty food packaging and red bull cans. She burps loudly. Sheldon is sitting on the sofa.」
Penny:「Okay, I'm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I'm going in.」
Sheldon:「Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.」
Penny:「Got it.」
Sheldon:「I must say, you're playing very well for a woman of 23?」
Penny:「22.」
Sheldon:「Right. 22. ''(Cut to his screen, he is filling in an online dating profile.)''」
Penny:「Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?」
Sheldon:「What happened to the rest of your group?」
Penny:「I dumped them, they're a bunch of wussies.」
Sheldon:「Frenzy stance.」
Penny:「Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!」
Sheldon:「So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「These are market research questions. I'm filling out the online registration for your game.」
Penny:「Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn't working, die you undead mummy, die!」
Sheldon:「Drink a healing potion.」
Penny:「Thank you.」
Sheldon:「You're welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?」
Penny:「That's on the registration?」
Sheldon:「Oh yes, it's quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.」
Penny:「Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I'm a big old five.」
Sheldon:「Good to know. Big old five.」
