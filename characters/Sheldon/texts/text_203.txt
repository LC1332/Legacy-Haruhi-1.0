Howard:「''(Voice from inside)'' Make sure they remember no peanuts.」
Leonard:「Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can't eat peanuts. They see me coming they go “ah, no peanut boy!”」
:「''(Leonard exits down stairs. A moment later, Penny peeks out of her apartment, checks the coast is clear, and crosses the hall to the guys apartment. Knocks.)''」
Sheldon:「''(Answering)'' Hello Penny. Leonard just left.」
Penny:「I know. I want to talk to you.」
Sheldon:「What would we talk about? We’ve no overlapping areas of interest I'm aware of, and you know I don't care for chit-chat.」
Penny:「Okay, can you just let me in.」
Sheldon:「Well alright, but I don't see this as a promising endeavour.」
Penny:「Okay, here's the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.」
Sheldon:「I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.」
