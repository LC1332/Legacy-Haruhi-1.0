Leonard:「Thanks for coming on such short notice.」
[[Mary Cooper]]:「You did the right thing calling.」
Leonard:「I didn't know what else to do, he's lost all focus, every day he's got a new obsession. ''(They enter the apartment. Sheldon is weaving on a loom. He is wrapped in a poncho.)'' This is a particularly disturbing one.」
Sheldon:「''(Looking around)'' Mommy?」
Mary Cooper:「Hi baby.」
Sheldon:「''(Mouths)'' You called my mother?」
Mary Cooper:「Oh, you got yourself a loom, how nice.」
Sheldon:「Thank you.」
Mary Cooper:「Honey, why did you get a loom?」
Sheldon:「I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?」
Mary Cooper:「Leonard called me.」
Sheldon:「I know, but why?」
Leonard:「Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes.」
Sheldon:「This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someone's mother.」
Leonard:「Really, when was the last time you left the house.」
Sheldon:「I went to the market with Penny.」
Leonard:「That was three weeks ago.」
Sheldon:「Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days she's going to get very crabby.」
Mary Cooper:「Sweetheart, your little friend is concerned about you.」
Sheldon:「Yes, well I'm not a child, I'm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly don't need someone telling on me to my mother.」
Leonard:「Where are you going?」
Sheldon:「To my room, and no-one's allowed in.」
