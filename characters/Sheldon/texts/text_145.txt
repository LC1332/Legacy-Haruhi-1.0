Howard:「''(Into phone)'' It's a small brown paper bag, Ma, I'm looking at it right now. ''(Pause.)'' Why would I make that up, there's no ding-dong in it. ''(Pause.)'' How are two ding-dongs tomorrow going to help me today?」
Sheldon:「''(Entering)'' So, this is engineering, huh?」
Howard:「''(Into phone)'' I'll talk to you later.」
Sheldon:「Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled laborers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science.」
Howard:「Sheldon, what are you doing here?」
Sheldon:「I just came by to say hello.」
Howard:「I’ve been at this lab for three years, you've never came by to say hello.」
Sheldon:「Well, up until now I’ve had better things to do. So, what are we making today?」
Howard:「A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that's going up on the next space shuttle.」
Sheldon:「Really, how does it work?」
Howard:「When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it.」
Sheldon:「Uh, huh. So it's a shelf?」
Howard:「No, you don't understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provide... yeah, okay, it's a shelf.」
Sheldon:「Now, I notice you're using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, they're lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength.」
Howard:「Sheldon, there's a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering.」
Sheldon:「And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes.」
Howard:「Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Yes.」
Howard:「Go away.」
Sheldon:「Did Leonard tell you to say that?」
Howard:「No, I thought of it all by myself.」
Sheldon:「Huh. It can't be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I'm missing.」
