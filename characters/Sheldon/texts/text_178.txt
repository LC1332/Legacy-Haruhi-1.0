Leonard:「That doesn't sound too bad.」
Penny:「It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.」
Leonard:「Sorry.」
Penny:「Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I’ve lost an entire day's pay thanks to this... this...」
Sheldon:「Time machine.」
Leonard:「The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?」
Penny:「No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and... and now that... that...」
Sheldon:「Again, time machine.」
Penny:「Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.」
Sheldon:「It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.」
