Sheldon:「Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!」
Leonard:「You okay?」
Sheldon:「No, it hurt... ''(looking around)'' Great Caesar's Ghost, look at this place?」
Leonard:「So Penny's a little messy.」
Sheldon:「A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organizational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. I'm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.」
Leonard:「Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organize and label the entire world around them?」
Sheldon:「No.」
Leonard:「Well they don't. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people don't sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content.」
Sheldon:「Excuse me, but I think we’ve both found that helpful at times.」
Leonard:「Come on, we should go.」
Sheldon:「Hang on.」
Leonard:「What are you doing?」
Sheldon:「Straightening up.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, this is not your home.」
Sheldon:「This is not anyone's home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy.」
Leonard:「When the transvestite lived here, you didn't care how he kept the place.」
Sheldon:「Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that man's closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms.」
Leonard:「What were you doing in his closet?」
Sheldon:「I helped him run some cable for a webcam.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Hey guys.」
Leonard:「Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now.」
Penny:「Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?」
Sheldon:「''(Sucks in breath)''」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「No?」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「No.」
Leonard:「Well, we'll get out of your hair.」
Penny:「Okay, great, thank you again ''(she throws her jacket over the back of the sofa).''」
Sheldon:「Penny, I just want you to know that, you don't have to live like this. I'm here for you.」
