Penny:「Ugh, I cannot believe Christy let Howard into my apartment.」
Sheldon:「And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note it's 8:13, and we're still not playing Halo.」
Leonard:「Okay, fine, we'll just play one on one until he gets back.」
Sheldon:「One on one? We don't play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!」
Leonard:「Well, the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.」
Raj:「Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, there's a billion more where he came from.」
Penny:「Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.」
Leonard:「Great idea.」
Sheldon:「Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that.」
Penny:「Why?」
Sheldon:「Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny.」
Penny:「Oh, what, what, what?」
Sheldon:「This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story.」
Penny:「''(Picking up a controller, there is the sound of an explosion from the television)'' Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off?」
Sheldon:「Mine.」
Penny:「Okay, I got this. Lock and load, boys.」
Leonard:「It's the only way we can play teams.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but whoever's her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that sh.... ''(another explosion)''」
Penny:「Ha-ha! There goes your head again.」
Sheldon:「Okay, this isn't at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody who's just respawned, you need to give them a chance to-- ''(explosion)'' Now, come on!」
Sheldon:「Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered, cover me.」
Penny:「Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!」
Leonard:「Penny, you are on fire.」
Penny:「Yeah, so is Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Okay, that's it, I don't know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game.」
Penny:「Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something.」
Sheldon:「What?」
Penny:「This plasma grenade. ''(Explosion.)'' Ha! Look, it's raining you!」
Sheldon:「You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support.」
