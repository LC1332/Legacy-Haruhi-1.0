Howard:「Mmmm, testify. ''(Puts up hand for a hand slap.)''」
Leslie:「I'm not touching that.」
Leonard:「Leslie, you are way off base here.」
Sheldon:「Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.」
Leslie:「Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.」
Sheldon:「Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.」
Howard:「I'll take the bullet.」
Leonard:「Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.」
Sheldon:「Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I'm going to take action. ''(Leans over to a good looking man on a nearby table.)'' Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?」
Man:「No.」
Sheldon:「Would you like to be?」
Man:「Uh, sure, why not?」
Leonard:「Sheldon...」
Sheldon:「Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?」
Man:「Uh... ''(checks out Sheldon’s package)'' Yeah, yeah. ''(Pulls out pen and writes it on Sheldon’s hand.)''」
Sheldon:「There, problem solved.」
