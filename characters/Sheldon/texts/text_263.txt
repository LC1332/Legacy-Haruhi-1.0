Penny:「''(Whispering)'' Sheldon. ''(Sing-song)'' Shel-don.」
Sheldon:「Danger, danger.」
Penny:「No danger, look, it's just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?」
Sheldon:「You're in my bedroom.」
Penny:「Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.」
Sheldon:「People can't be in my bedroom.」
Penny:「Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?」
Sheldon:「I'm not wearing pajama bottoms.」
Penny:「Why not?」
Sheldon:「I spilled grape juice.」
Penny:「Well, wear different pajamas.」
Sheldon:「I can't wear different pajamas, these are my Monday pajamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.」
Penny:「Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?」
Sheldon:「You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?」
Penny:「Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I'm just not sure it's the right move for my character.」
Sheldon:「Of course it's not, you're only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.」
Penny:「Really? Boy, you'd think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.」
:「Cut to Leonard, exiting his bedroom.」
Sheldon:「''(Off)'' Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.」
