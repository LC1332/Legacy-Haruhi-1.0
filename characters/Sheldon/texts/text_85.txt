Penny:「''(Answering)'' Oh, hey guys, what's up?」
Sheldon:「It's Halo night.」
Penny:「Yeah. Okay. So?」
Leonard:「Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy,」
Penny:「She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.」
Leonard:「Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.」
Penny:「Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.」
Sheldon:「You can't go out, it's Halo night.」
Penny:「Well, for Penny it's dancing night.」
Sheldon:「You go dancing every Wednesday?」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Then it's not dancing night.」
Penny:「Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?」
Sheldon:「Tonight is Halo night! It's like talking to a wall.」
Penny:「Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.」
Penny:「Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.」
Leonard:「Maybe we should've asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend.」
Sheldon:「Okay, assuming we could dance, which we can't, there are three of us and two of them.」
Leonard:「So?」
Sheldon:「It's the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is child's play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman.」
Leonard:「Aaah, for God's sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy.」
Sheldon:「Your anger's not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics.」
Leonard:「No, I'm pretty sure my anger's with you.」
Raj:「What's happening to us? We’re falling apart.」
Leonard:「Who are you calling?」
Sheldon:「The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.」
