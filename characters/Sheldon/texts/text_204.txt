Penny:「He just doesn't know he wants one because he's never had one.」
Howard:「I suppose that's possible, but for the record, I’ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.」
Penny:「Howard, here's the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over.」
Howard:「Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it. I'm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend?」
Sheldon:「I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish.」
Penny:「Anguish?」
Sheldon:「Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation.」
Penny:「Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party.」
Sheldon:「Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity.」
Penny:「Nevertheless, we are....」
Sheldon:「In addition I really don't think that Leonard wants a...」
Penny:「Okay, here's the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won't know which, I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.」
Sheldon:「You can't do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it's no longer mint.」
Penny:「Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?」
Sheldon:「Well of course I... oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let's throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.」
