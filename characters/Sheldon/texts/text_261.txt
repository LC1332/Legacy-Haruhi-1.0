Howard:「Let her rip.」
:「''(Leonard turns on stereo with a remote. Rhythmic bass-heavy music plays. The liquid begins dancing on the speaker.)''」
Penny:「''(Entering, carrying a laptop)'' Hi!」
Leonard:「Hey, check it out, it's just corn starch and water.」
Sheldon:「They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.」
Howard:「That's what makes it get all funky.」
Penny:「Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.」
Howard:「''(After Raj whispers in his ear)'' No, that's what she said, Sheldon.」
Penny:「Okay, look, I bought the game, and I’ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can't figure out how to get past the guard captain.」
Sheldon:「Do you have the enchanted sword?」
Penny:「No, no, I’ve a bronze dagger.」
Sheldon:「You can't slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it's like the car key in your apartment door all over again.」
Penny:「Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?」
Sheldon:「Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?」
Penny:「Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?」
Sheldon:「No, no, no, it's... oh for God's sakes, gimme. ''(Takes laptop.)''」
Penny:「Thank you, I really appreciate this.」
Sheldon:「You're going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.」
