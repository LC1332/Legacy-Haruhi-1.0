Howard:「How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC...」
Penny:「Guys, this is actually really simple.」
Howard:「Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.」
Leonard:「Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?」
Sheldon:「And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.」
Penny:「Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.」
Leonard:「Oh, I’ve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminum.」
Sheldon:「Right, then the entire thing's one big heat sink.」
