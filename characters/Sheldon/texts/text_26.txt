Leonard:「I'm very, very sorry.」
Penny:「Do you understand how creepy this is.」
Leonard:「Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.」
Penny:「In my apartment, while I was sleeping.」
Sheldon:「And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.」
Penny:「And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?」
Sheldon:「Depending on the depth, that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon. ''(Leonard holds up a sign reading “Sarcasm”)'' Oh!」
Penny:「God!」
Leonard:「Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.」
Penny:「Stay away from me.」
Leonard:「Sure, that's another way to go.」
Sheldon:「Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organizational paradigm. ''(Penny stares in disbelief, then leaves.)'' Well that was a little non-responsive.」
Leonard:「You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologize. ''(Sheldon laughs.)'' What's funny?」
Sheldon:「That wasn't sarcasm?」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「Whoo, boy, you are all over the place this morning. ''(Knocks on Penny’s door.)'' I have a masters and two PhD's, I should not have to do this.」
Penny:「''(Opening door)'' What?」
Sheldon:「I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it won't color your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover. ''(Penny closes door in his face.)'' I did what I could.」
