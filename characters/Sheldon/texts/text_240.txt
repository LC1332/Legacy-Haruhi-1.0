Howard:「We’re just talking ma.」
Mrs. Wolowitz:「If you don't settle down right now, I'm not going to let you have any more sleepovers.」
Howard:「For God's sake, ma, I'm 27 years old. It's not even a school night! ''(To Sheldon)'' Comfy now?」
Sheldon:「Meh. That poster of Halle Berry's a little unnerving.」
Howard:「So don't look at it.」
Sheldon:「She's like my fourth favorite catwoman.」
Howard:「No kidding?」
Sheldon:「Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her.」
Howard:「What about Lee Meriwether?」
Sheldon:「Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether.」
Howard:「Well I'm glad that's settled.」
Sheldon:「That makes Halle Berry my fifth favorite catwoman. There's Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee Meriwether...」
Howard:「Please, I'm begging you, go to sleep.」
Sheldon:「I'm trying, I'm counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though.」
Howard:「Oh for God's sake.」
Sheldon:「But she's not my favorite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel....」
