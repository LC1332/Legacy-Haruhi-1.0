Leonard:「Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?」
Penny:「Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!」
Leonard:「I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it's starting to attract wildlife.」
Penny:「Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?」
Sheldon:「It doesn't matter, right now you're looking for treasure.」
Penny:「Okay. ''(Leonard motions for Sheldon to talk in the kitchen.)'' Wait, wait, where are you going?」
Sheldon:「You're okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.」
Leonard:「Want to catch me up?」
Sheldon:「Well let's see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn't had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.」
Leonard:「Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?」
Penny:「Oh my God, a treasure chest, I'm rich!」
Sheldon:「Level three and she thinks she's rich! What a noob.」
