'''Scene''':「''The stairs of the apartment building.''」
Sheldon:「Are you still mad about the sperm bank?」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?」
Leonard:「Not really.」
Sheldon:「If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip.」
Leonard:「I don't care. Two millimetres? That doesn't seem right.」
Sheldon:「No, it's true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle.」
Leonard:「Is that why they sent you to boarding school?」
Sheldon:「No, that was the result of my work with lasers.」
Leonard:「New neighbor?」
Sheldon:「Evidently.」
Leonard:「Significant improvement over the old neighbor.」
Sheldon:「Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is.」
Penny:「Oh, hi!」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
