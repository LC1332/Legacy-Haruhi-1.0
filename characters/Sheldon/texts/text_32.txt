Howard:「What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?」
Penny:「A shower.」
Howard:「I'll take the heart smart platter.」
Penny:「Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「We don't eat here, I don't know what's good.」
Penny:「Well, it's all good.」
Sheldon:「Statistically unlikely.」
Leonard:「Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.」
Sheldon:「I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.」
Leonard:「I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.」
Penny:「Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?」
Sheldon:「Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.」
Penny:「The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.」
Sheldon:「Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?」
Penny:「Because you are not at Big Boy!」
Sheldon:「Fine, I'll have the Barbecue Burger.」
Leonard:「Make it two.」
Sheldon:「Waitresses don't yell at you at Big Boy.」
