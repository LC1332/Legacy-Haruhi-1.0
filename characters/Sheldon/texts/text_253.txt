Sheldon:「''(Entering)'' When the two of you reach a natural stopping point I'd like to have a word.」
Leonard:「If the word is pee-pee, just do it.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.」
Leonard:「Thank you.」
Sheldon:「I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun.」
Leslie:「Hang on a second. Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.」
Sheldon:「I'm listening, amuse me.」
Leslie:「Okay, well, for one thing we expect quantii space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors.」
Sheldon:「Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.」
