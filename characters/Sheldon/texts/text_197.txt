Missy:「Okay. I'm not even going to ask why you're pimping me out for cheese. But since when do you care at all about who I sleep with?」
Sheldon:「Truthfully, I’ve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential.」
Missy:「What on earth are you talking about?」
Sheldon:「Let me explain. You see, I'm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock.」
Missy:「And what do you mean, mediocre stock?」
Sheldon:「That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will.」
Missy:「Sheldon 2.0?」
Sheldon:「Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If you're not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced.」
Missy:「You have got to be kidding me!」
Sheldon:「Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation.」
Missy:「Okay Shelly, sit down. Now I’ve lived my whole life dealing with the fact that my twin brother is, as Mom puts it, one of God's special little people.」
Sheldon:「I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, that's where the metaphor ended.」
Missy:「I thought it ended at cuckoo. Now you listen to me, if you want to start acting like a brother who cares about me, then terrific. Bring it on. But you try one time to tell me who I should be sleeping with, and you and I are going to go round and round the way we did when we were little. Re[[File:Missy_Cooper.jpg|thumb|Missy]] member? ''(Sheldon hurriedly crosses his legs.)''」
Sheldon:「I have an alternate proposal.」
Missy:「Go on.」
Sheldon:「You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins.」
