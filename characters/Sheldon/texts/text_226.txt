'''Scene''':「''The flat, Leonard is entering, singing to himself a depressing song.''」
Sheldon:「Oh, good lord.」
Leonard:「''(Singing)'' You don't know me, you don't wear my chains, oh yeah... God, that's a good song.」
Sheldon:「If you're compiling a mix CD for a double suicide. ''(Leonard is taking supplies out of a bag'') Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you.」
Leonard:「I know what you're thinking, I’ve taken your asthma into account. There's a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, listen to me...」
Leonard:「I’ve been thinking about names, I'm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?」
Leonard:「Maybe, if it's a cute little cuddly cat.」
Sheldon:「Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny.」
Leonard:「It doesn't matter. The woman's not interested in me, the woman rejected me.」
Sheldon:「Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the center of every black hole is a little man with a flash light searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out.」
Leonard:「You're right. I didn't ask her out, I should ask her out.」
Sheldon:「No. No, now that was not my point. My point was, don't buy a cat.」
Leonard:「No, but you're right. I should march over there and ask her out.」
Sheldon:「Oh, goody, we’re getting a cat.」
