Howard:「No.」
Leonard:「Here, let me try. Call M'kflono M'kflooniloo. Heh-heh.」
Howard's phone:「Calling Rajesh Koothrappali. ''(Raj’s phone rings)''.」
Raj:「Oh, that's very impressive. And a little racist.」
Sheldon:「If we’re all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night? We were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06.」
Leonard:「So? We'll start now.」
Sheldon:「Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break.」
Raj:「We can split it two, two and two.」
Howard:「If we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time. ''(There is a knock on the door.)''」
Sheldon:「Oh, what fresh hell is this?」
