Gablehouser:「''(Entering)'' Dr Cooper? Oh, are we interrupting?」
Sheldon:「No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think you'll appreciate this, very exciting.」
Gablehouser:「Oh, what are you working on?」
Sheldon:「Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I’ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I'm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.」
Gablehouser:「To what end?」
Sheldon:「You know, it's like the baseball movie, build it and they will come.」
Gablehouser:「Who will come?」
Sheldon:「The Jewish people.」
Gablehouser:「What if they don't come.」
Sheldon:「We'll make it nice, put out a spread.」
Gablehouser:「Okay, well, um, speaking of spreads, we’re having a small welcoming party this afternoon for Mr Kim, who's agreed to join us here at the University.」
Sheldon:「Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, can't you.」
Gablehouser:「Okay, well, uh, obviously you're very busy with your... uh, um, come Dennis. You'll have to excuse Dr Cooper, he's been under a lot of... um... he's nuts.」
Sheldon:「''(Voice off, sings to a Mexican tune)'' Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. They'll come, they'll settle and I'll win the prize...」
