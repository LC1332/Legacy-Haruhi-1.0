'''Scene''':「''Leonard and Sheldon, Inside Leonard’s car''」
Sheldon:「I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.」
Leonard:「Must we?」
Sheldon:「Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive halfway across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman's ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?」
Leonard:「She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause.」
Leonard:「Which is?」
Sheldon:「You think with your penis.」
Leonard:「That's a biological impossibility and you didn't have to come.」
Sheldon:「Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why can't she get her own TV.」
Leonard:「Come on, you know how it is with break-ups.」
Sheldon:「No, I don't. And neither do you.」
Leonard:「Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim.」
Sheldon:「You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea.」
Leonard:「To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. There's some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.」
Sheldon:「So we get to have a scene with him?」
Leonard:「No, Sheldon, there's not going to be a scene. There's two of us and one of him.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, the two of us can't even carry a TV.」
