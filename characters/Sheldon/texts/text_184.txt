Howard:「Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.」
Raj:「Too bad, I called dibs.」
Howard:「Well you can't just call dibs.」
Raj:「I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.」
Sheldon:「Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.」
Leonard:「It's not a bidding war, I'm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store.」
Raj:「Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?」
Howard:「Will you forget dibs!」
Leonard:「He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.」
Sheldon:「What's the number, I'll match it.」
Raj:「I'll match it, plus a thousand rupees.」
Sheldon:「What's the exchange rate.」
Raj:「None of your business. Take it or leave it.」
Howard:「''(On phone)'' Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel.」
Leonard:「Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.」
Sheldon:「Who cares, as long as you pick me.」
Raj:「Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let's talk.」
Leonard:「Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.」
Sheldon:「''(Moving to block his path)'' No. I can't let you do this.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, get out of my way.」
Sheldon:「''(Brandishing toy sword from Leonard’s box)'' None shall pass.」
Leonard:「Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek:  The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.」
Howard:「Okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here.」
Penny:「''(Coming out of her flat)'' What the hell's going on?」
Sheldon:「You hypocrite!」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!」
