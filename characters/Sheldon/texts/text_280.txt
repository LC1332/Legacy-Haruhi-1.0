Raj:「So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shoot... have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?」
Leonard:「No.」
Raj:「It's fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this. (Stares into space.) They're going to digitally add a supernova, they say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent.」
Sheldon:「Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself. (Leonard nudges him. He smiles. Phone rings.)」
Raj:「Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.」
Howard:「They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.」
Sheldon:「Have we at this point met our social obligations?」
