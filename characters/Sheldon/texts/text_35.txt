'''Scene''':「''The stairwell of the apartment building.''」
Leonard:「What did Penny mean, you'd make a cute couple?」
Sheldon:「Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, aren't they adorable.」
Leonard:「If Penny didn't know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. That's too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available.」
Sheldon:「You're a lucky man, Leonard.」
Leonard:「How so?」
Sheldon:「You're talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought.」
Leonard:「Well, what do you think.」
Sheldon:「I said I could follow it, I didn't say I cared.」
