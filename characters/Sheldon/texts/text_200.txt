Missy:「Any news you want me to pass along to Mom?」
Sheldon:「Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory.」
Missy:「Yeah, I'll just tell her you said hey.」
Sheldon:「Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. ''(Holds out hand to shake.)''」
Missy:「Come on, Shelly. ''(Hugs him. He looks uncomfortable, then hugs back half heartedly.)'' I want you to know I'm very proud of you.」
Sheldon:「Really?」
Missy:「Yup, I'm always bragging to my friends about my brother the rocket scientist.」
Sheldon:「You tell people I'm a rocket scientist?」
Missy:「Well yeah.」
Sheldon:「I'm a theoretical physicist.」
Missy:「What's the difference?」
Sheldon:「What's the difference?」
Missy:「Goodbye Shelly.」
Sheldon:「My God! Why don't you just tell them I'm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating.」
