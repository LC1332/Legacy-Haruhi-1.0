Howard:「If that's a working stethoscope, maybe you'd like to hear my heart skip a beat.」
Nurse Costume Girl:「No thanks.」
Howard:「No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.」
Leonard:「I  want to get to know Penny's friends, I just, I don't know how to talk to these people.」
Sheldon:「Well, I actually might be able to help.」
Leonard:「How so?」
Sheldon:「Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will.」
Leonard:「Go on.」
Sheldon:「Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting “How wasted am I?” which is met with an approving chorus of “Dude.”」
Leonard:「Then what happens?」
Sheldon:「That's as far as I’ve gotten.」
Leonard:「This is ridiculous, I'm jumping in.」
Sheldon:「Good luck.」
Leonard:「No, you're coming with me.」
Sheldon:「Oh, I hardly think so.」
Leonard:「Come on.」
Sheldon:「Aren’t you afraid I'll embarrass you?」
Leonard:「Yes. But I need a wing-man.」
Sheldon:「Alright, but if we’re going to use flight metaphors I'm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analyzing wreckage.」
Girl in Hippie Costume:「Oh, Hi!」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hello.」
Girl:「So, what are you supposed to be?」
Sheldon:「Me? I'll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!」
Girl:「Uh, a choo-choo train?」
Sheldon:「Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!」
