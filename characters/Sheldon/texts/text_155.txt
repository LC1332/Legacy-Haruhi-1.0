Leonard:「This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.」
Penny:「Zod?」
Howard:「Kryptonian villain. Long story.」
Raj:「Good story. ''(Clasps hands to mouth in shock.)''」
Sheldon:「Well count me out.」
Howard:「What? Why?」
Sheldon:「You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish?」
Leonard:「Come on, you need a four-person team, we’re four people.」
Sheldon:「By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.」
Penny:「I want tickets to that please.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock's dying words to you.」
Sheldon:「No, don't.」
Leonard:「The needs of the many.」
Howard:「Outweigh the needs of the few.」
Sheldon:「Or the one. Dammit, I'll do it.」
