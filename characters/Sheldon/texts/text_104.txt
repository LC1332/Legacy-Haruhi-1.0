Raj:「Yes Mommy.」
Mrs. Koothrappali:「Because you know what happens to the samosas when you wear the tidy whities.」
Raj:「Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did.」
Sheldon:「What did I do?」
Leonard:「You left with his date. Friends don't do that to each other.」
Sheldon:「Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry.」
Raj:「Sorry? That's all you can say is sorry?」
Leonard:「Take it, Raj. It's more than I’ve ever gotten.」
Sheldon:「And may I point out she wouldn't have asked me to go with her if you hadn't been drunk and boring.」
Dr. Koothrappali:「Drunk?」
Sheldon:「And boring, her words.」
