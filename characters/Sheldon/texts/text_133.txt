Penny:「No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?」

Penny:「Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.」
Sheldon:「I want soup.」

Sheldon:「I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.」
Penny:「Okay, what kind of soup do you want.」
Sheldon:「Well, my mother used to make me this [http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Homemade_Soup split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home-made croutons].」
Penny:「We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek.」
Sheldon:「Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Then surprise me. ''(Blows nose into handkerchief. Shows it to next table)'' Would you call that moss green or forest green?」
