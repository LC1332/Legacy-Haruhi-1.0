'''Scene''':「[[Apartment 4A]]」
Sheldon:「Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and Swiss on wholewheat.」
Raj:「What did they give you?」
Sheldon:「Turkey and roast beef with Swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It's the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash.」
Leonard:「I don't believe it.」
Sheldon:「I know, it's basic culinary science.」
