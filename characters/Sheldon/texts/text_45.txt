Leonard:「Morning」
Sheldon:「Morning.」
Leonard:「You're making eggs for breakfast?」
Sheldon:「This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.」
Leonard:「Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.」
Sheldon:「I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste.」
Leonard:「Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.」
Sheldon:「As do I.」
Leonard:「You know, I'm sure if you just apologized to Gablehouser he would give you your job back.」
Sheldon:「I don't want my job back. I’ve spent the last three and a half years staring at grease boards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and I'm going to savour it.」
Leonard:「Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.」
Sheldon:「I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.」
Leonard:「And we all thank you.」
Sheldon:「Use new eggs. ''(There is a knock on the door).''」
Penny:「''(Popping her head round)'' Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?」
Sheldon:「Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.」
Penny:「I'm sorry?」
Sheldon:「I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.」
Penny:「Four dozen?」
Sheldon:「Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.」
Penny:「Okay, one more time?」
Sheldon:「Never mind, you won't get it right, I'd better come with you.」
