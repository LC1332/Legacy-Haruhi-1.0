Raj:「Oh, okay, Leonard?」
Leonard:「Well, uh, no I... the... no.」
Raj:「Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「I can make it, but I won't.」
Penny:「What are you guys talking about?」
Raj:「Well, there's a reception for my magazine article on Saturday.」
Penny:「And you guys aren't going? I can't believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and you're not even going to be there to support him?」
Sheldon:「A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.」
