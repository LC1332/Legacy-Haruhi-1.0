Leonard:「It's... you know, time machine.」
Penny:「Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so....」
Leonard:「Uh, just give us a few minutes.」
Penny:「I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.」
Sheldon:「Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.」
Penny:「You're joking, right?」
Sheldon:「Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.」
Penny:「Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof.」
Leonard:「Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it's not... never mind.」
Sheldon:「For what it's worth, I thought it was humorous.」
