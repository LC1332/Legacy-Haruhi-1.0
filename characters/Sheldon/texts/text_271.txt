Howard:「Creepy good or creepy bad?」
Leonard:「Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?」
Howard:「That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight. (To Penny) I'm not necessarily talking to the food.」
Penny:「Sit over there.」
Sheldon:「Sit over there. Baby wipe?」
Penny:「What do you have....」
Leonard and Howard together:「Don't! Don't! Don't!」
Sheldon:「I'll tell you why.」
Leonard and Howard:「O-o-o-oh!」
Sheldon:「I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.」
Penny:「I thought the blowers were more sanitary?」
Leonard and Howard:「Why? Don't!」
Sheldon:「Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.」
