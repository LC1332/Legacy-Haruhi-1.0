'''Scene''':「The building entrance lobby. The guys enter. Sheldon is dressed as a medieval monk, Howard is a court jester, Raj is a medieval gentleman and Leonard is a knight.」
Sheldon:「Worst Renaissance Fair ever.」
Leonard:「Please let it go, Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine.」
Leonard:「You're nitpicking.」
Sheldon:「Oh-ho! Really? Well here's another "nit" for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.」
Howard:「Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy. They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.」
Sheldon:「Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”」
Howard:「I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.」
Penny:「''(Arriving with Eric)'' Hi guys. Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair. I'm hoping.」
Sheldon:「Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.」
