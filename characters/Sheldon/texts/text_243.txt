Eric:「''(Leaving, to Howard)'' Like your hat.」
Howard:「Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.」
Leonard:「It wasn't awkward. It wasn't fun. Besides, what's the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now we’re both moving on.」
Raj:「By moving on, do you mean, she's going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?」
Sheldon:「That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you can't just put “ye olde” in front of anything and expect to get away with it.」
Leonard:「Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear.」
Sheldon:「You're wearing modern underwear?」
Leonard:「Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?」
Sheldon:「I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.」
Leonard:「You went out and bought linen?」
Sheldon:「Don't be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases.」
