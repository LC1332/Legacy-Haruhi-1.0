Leonard:「Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo.」
Man:「Au contraire. I'm 26 years old, I'm originally from ''(reads off crib notes)'' Denton, Texas, but I was a Navy brat so I was brought up on a variety of military bases around the world, as a result I’ve often felt like an outsider, never really fitting in, which is probably the reason for my substance abuse problem.」
Sheldon:「Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention.」
Man:「Oh, Sheldon, are we really going to go with pop psychology.」
Sheldon:「For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you.」
Leonard:「Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「I'm sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, he's a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theater at MIT.」
[[Toby Loobenfeld|Toby]]:「It was more of a double major actually. Theater and physics. You can guess which one my bourgeois parents pushed me towards.」
Leonard:「Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?」
Sheldon:「Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us.」
Leonard:「Oh...!」
Toby:「Sheldon, how about this as my motivation. When I was fourteen years old I was abused in the Philippines by a club footed Navy chaplain.」
Sheldon:「No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.」
Toby:「Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?」
Sheldon:「Subtextually, of course. ''(There is a knock on the door.)'' Just have fun with it. ''(Opening door.)'' Morning Penny.」
Penny:「Hi. How did the intervention go.」
Sheldon:「Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.」
Penny:「Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.」
Sheldon:「But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbor.」
