Howard:「See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.」
Penny:「No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.」
Leonard:「Sure. What's going on?」
Penny:「Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christy. Well, anyway, she called me up and she's like “Hey, how’s California,” and I'm like “Awesome” ‘cause, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.」
Sheldon:「8:08.」
