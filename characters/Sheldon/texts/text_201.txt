Penny:「Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.」
Leonard:「Oh, it's called trestling.」
Howard:「It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport.」
Penny:「Yeah, that's terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. ''(To someone off)'' Right come on guys, come on. ''(Singing while approaching another table)'' Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...」
Sheldon:「We might as well stop, it's a stalemate. You're beating me in tetris, but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.」
Raj:「Keebler Elf? I’ve got your Keebler Elf right here. ''(Strains to push Sheldon’s arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.)'' Okay, it's a stalemate.」
Penny:「So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?」
Sheldon:「He can't eat cheesecake, he's lactose intolerant.」
Penny:「Okay, he can have carrot cake.」
Sheldon:「What about the cream cheese frosting.」
Penny:「he can scrape it off.」
Leonard:「Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday?」
Penny:「I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody's until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.」
Sheldon:「For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum.」
