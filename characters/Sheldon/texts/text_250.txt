Leonard:「I sure hope so.」
Leslie:「Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?」
Sheldon:「''(Entering)'' I'm sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue.」
Leslie:「Uh, genetic weaknesses, right, um, there's the lactose intolerance.」
Sheldon:「''(Preparing an extension cord)'' Don't forget the male pattern baldness. When his uncles sit around the dinner table they look like a half carton of eggs. ''(Exits. Extension cord trails after him. Eventually goes tight a couple of times then falls loose.)''」
Leonard:「Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. So... Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me. ''(Sheldon knocks and enters again.)'' What now?」
Sheldon:「I have to make pee-pee.」
