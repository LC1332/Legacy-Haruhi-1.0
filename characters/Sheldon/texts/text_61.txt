Raj:「What? Just because I'm Indian I can't be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That's racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he's not English, but he's dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon ''(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines)'' is neither sound nor light, but he's obviously the Doppler Effect.」
Howard:「I'm not Peter Pan, I'm Robin Hood.」
Raj:「Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you're dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it's basically the same look, man.」
Leonard:「Hey, Sheldon, there's something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.」
Sheldon:「I don't care if anybody gets it, I'm going as the Doppler Effect.」
Leonard:「No, it's not...」
Sheldon:「If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!」
Leonard:「Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight.」
Sheldon:「Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?」
Leonard:「For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey.」
Sheldon:「Well, there's nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting.」
