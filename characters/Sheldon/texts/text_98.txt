Leonard:「Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you.」
Penny:「Okay, Raj, what'll it be? ''(Raj whispers in Leonard’s ear.)''」
Leonard:「Whatever you recommend.」
Penny:「Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?」
Sheldon:「I'll have a diet coke.」
Penny:「Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks.」
Sheldon:「Fine. I'll have a virgin Cuba libre.」
Penny:「That's, um, rum and coke without the rum.」
Sheldon:「Yes,」
Penny:「So coke.」
Sheldon:「Yes. And would you make it diet?」
Penny:「There's a can in the fridge.」
Sheldon:「A Cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.」
Penny:「Then swim to Cuba.」
Sheldon:「Bartenders are supposed to have people skills.」
