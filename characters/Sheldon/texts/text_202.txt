Leonard:「I don't celebrate my birthday.」
Penny:「Shuddup, yeah you do.」
Leonard:「No, it's no big deal, it's just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.」
Penny:「Uh, that's so silly.」
Sheldon:「It's actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it.」
Penny:「What was it called, “I hate my son and that’s why he can’t have cake?”」
Sheldon:「It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it.」
