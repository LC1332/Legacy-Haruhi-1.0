'''Scene''':「''Ground floor hallway of the apartment building. Leonard is signing for the delivery.''」
Leonard:「Okay, her apartment's on the fourth floor but the elevator's broken so you're going to have to ''(delivery man leaves)'' oh, you're just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.」
Sheldon:「I hardly think so.」
Leonard:「Why not?」
Sheldon:「Well, we don't have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength.」
Leonard:「We don't need strength, we’re physicists. We are the intellectual descendants of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, it's just a matter of... ''(starts to move package)'' I don't have this... I don't have this I don't have this.」
Sheldon:「Archimedes would be so proud.」
Leonard:「Do you have any ideas?」
Sheldon:「Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring.」
Leonard:「Easy, easy ''(package falls)'' Okay! Now we’ve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half.」
Sheldon:「Exactly half.」
Leonard:「''(Snarkily)'' Exactly half. Let's push. Okay, see, it's moving, this is easy, all in the math.」
Sheldon:「What's your formula for the corner.」
Leonard:「What? Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn.」
Sheldon:「Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch.」
Sheldon:「You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?」
Leonard:「Men do things for women without expecting sex.」
Sheldon:「Yeah, those are men who just had sex.」
Leonard:「I'm doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, there's no way it could lower the odds.」
Leonard:「Almost there, almost there, almost there. ''(Lets go of package, it starts to slip down)''」
Sheldon:「No we’re not, no we’re not, no we’re not!」
