Raj:「But you're a dentist, he's nuts.」
Lalita:「Don't be insulting Rajesh. So, Sheldon, tell me more about this princess you say I look like.」
Sheldon:「It was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips.」
Lalita:「Oh my.」
Raj:「Back off Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「What?」
Raj:「If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.」
Sheldon:「I'm not hitting on her.」
