Gablehauser:「Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologizes.」
Sheldon:「No she doesn't.」
Leslie:「No I don't.」
Sheldon:「Here's the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.」
Leslie:「It wasn't even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.」
Sheldon:「If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty. ''(His phone rings.)'' Oh, Penny!」
Gablehauser:「You need to get that Dr Cooper?」
Sheldon:「God, no.」
Leslie:「Well don't turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you've been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year.」
Sheldon:「Oh yeah, well, you wouldn't even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she's doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock...」
Gablehauser:「''(As phone rings)'' Excuse me. Gablehauser. ''(Holding phone out to Sheldon)''It's for you.」
Sheldon:「Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you're not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can't log on and help you. We'll talk when I get home. ''(Puts phone down)'' I'm not getting the computing time, am I?」
