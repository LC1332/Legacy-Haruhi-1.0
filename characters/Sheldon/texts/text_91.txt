Sheldon:「Damn you, walletnook.com.」
Leonard:「Problem?」
Sheldon:「The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they don't tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, it's a nightmare.」
Leonard:「Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?」
Sheldon:「It's been in every wallet I’ve owned since I was five.」
Leonard:「Why?」
Sheldon:「It says keep this on your person at all times. ''(Knock on door)'' It's right here under Batman's signature.」
