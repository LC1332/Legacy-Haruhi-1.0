Penny:「Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.」
Leonard:「What about Saturday?」
Penny:「You know, I'm not sure, the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.」
Leonard:「Great. So you just let me know when you know. So... ''(she leaves)'' Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?」
Sheldon:「Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things. ''(Runs away.)''」
Leonard:「''(Chasing him)'' What does that mean?」
Sheldon:「Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.」
Leonard:「No I didn't.」
Sheldon:「I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir.」
Leonard:「What's going on with you?」
Sheldon:「Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak. ''(His eye begins to twitch.)''」
Leonard:「What's wrong with your face?」
Sheldon:「There's no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard.」
Leonard:「What?」
Sheldon:「I said Good Day! ''(He leaves)''」
