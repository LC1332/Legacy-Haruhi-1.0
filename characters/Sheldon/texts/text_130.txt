'''Scene''':「''The kitchen of Apartment 4A night time. Sheldon is busy doing something scientific. There is a lot of scientific paraphernalia strewn across the table. Leonard comes in.''」
Leonard:「What the hell are you doing?」
Sheldon:「I'm making petri dishes to grow throat cultures.」
Leonard:「''(confusedly)'' With lime jello?」
Sheldon:「I need a growth medium, and '''someone''' polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat. ''(opens his mouth)''」
Leonard:「I don't think so.」
Sheldon:「Leonard! If I'm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what's growing in my throat. ''(opens his mouth again)''」
Leonard:「Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.」
Sheldon:「We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska I'm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, don't you think you're overreacting?」
Sheldon:「When I'm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance. ''(opens his mouth yet again, insistently)''」
Leonard:「''(annoyed)'' I'm going back to bed.」
Sheldon:「Wait. ''(Handing him a measuring jug)'' Put this in the bathroom.」
Leonard:「What for?」
Sheldon:「I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren't shutting down.」
Leonard:「''(angry)'' I mix pancake batter in this!」
Sheldon:「No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.」
Leonard:「You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn't have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup?」
Sheldon:「It's right here on the bottom.」
