Leonard:「Sheldon, I'm so sorry I dragged you through this.」
Sheldon:「It's okay. It wasn't my first pantsing, and it won't be my last.」
Leonard:「And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex.」
Sheldon:「Well you got me out of my pants.」
Leonard:「Anyway, I’ve learned my lesson. She's out of my league, I'm done with her, I’ve got my work, one day I'll win the Nobel Prize and then I'll die alone.」
Sheldon:「Don't think like that, you're not going to die alone.」
Leonard:「Thank you Sheldon, you're a good friend.」
Sheldon:「And you're certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.」
