Sheldon:「Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.」
Howard:「No, it's Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. ''(Makes a hand movement with every syllable.)''」
Sheldon:「Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. ''(Copies hand movements.)''」
Howard:「What's this? ''(Repeats hand movements.)''」
Sheldon:「That's what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.」
Howard:「Well it's not.」
Sheldon:「How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher it's your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter.」
Howard:「You know, I'm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin.」
Sheldon:「Why?」
Howard:「Once you're fluent you'll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me.」
Leonard:「''(Entering)'' Hey!」
Sheldon:「Mai du lui tsa.」
Howard:「You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey.」
Sheldon:「My apologies Leonard, I'm only as good as my teacher.」
Leonard:「Why are you learning Chinese?」
Sheldon:「I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.」
