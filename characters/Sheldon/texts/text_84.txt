Leonard:「This isn't a substitution, it's a reduction.」
Chen:「Okay, no reductions.」
Leonard:「Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, that's twelve, we'll each have four.」
Raj:「That works.」
Sheldon:「No, if we fill up on dumplings we'll need to eliminate another entree.」
Chen:「No eliminations.」
Leonard:「If we have extra, we'll just take the leftovers home.」
Sheldon:「And divide it how? I'm telling you, we cannot do this without Wolowitz.」
Leonard:「Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend. If you had let me invite Penny, then you would have had your fourth.」
Sheldon:「Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food? She uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls.」
Leonard:「We don't order egg rolls.」
Sheldon:「Exactly, but we'd have to if she was here.」
Raj:「Can we please make a decision? Not only are there children starving in India, there's an Indian starving right here.」
Leonard:「Here's an idea, why don't we just go out for Indian food.」
Sheldon:「No.」
Raj:「Uurgh.」
Chen:「You are nice boys. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring you the four dumplings. When I'm walking over to the table, maybe I get bumped, one of the dumplings falls to the floor, no-one has to know.」
Sheldon:「I'll know.」
Chen:「''(wanders away cursing in Mandarin.)''」
Raj:「How about soup?」
Leonard:「Yeah, we can always divide soup.」
Sheldon:「What about the won-tons?」
