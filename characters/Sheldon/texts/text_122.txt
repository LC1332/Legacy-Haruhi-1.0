Leonard:「No, we’re not going to Long Beach.」
Raj:「Why not?」
Leonard:「Because Sheldon doesn't have a drug addicted cousin Leopold.」
Raj:「Oh, too bad. I’ve always wanted to go to Long Beach.」
Sheldon:「It's a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, it's now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner.」
Raj:「Sounds fun.」
Howard:「I'm game.」
Raj:「Shotgun.」
Sheldon:「No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then it's iffy.」
