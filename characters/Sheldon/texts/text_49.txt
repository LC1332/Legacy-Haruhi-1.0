Leonard:「''(Entering)'' Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something.」
Sheldon:「I think it's her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference.」
Leonard:「What's with the fish?」
Sheldon:「It's an experiment.」
Leonard:「What happened to your scrambled egg research?」
Sheldon:「Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as they're ever going to be.」
Leonard:「So... fish.」
Sheldon:「I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights.」
Leonard:「Fish nightlights.」
Sheldon:「It's a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!」
Leonard:「Mum's the word. Sheldon, are you sure you don't want to just apologize to Gablehouser and get your job back.」
Sheldon:「Oh, no, no, no. No, I’ve too much to do.」
Leonard:「Like luminous fish.」
Sheldon:「Shhhhh!」
Leonard:「Right... I didn't....」
Sheldon:「That's just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, we’re going to be rich.」
