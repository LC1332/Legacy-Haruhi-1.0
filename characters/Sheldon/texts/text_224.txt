Leonard:「No, I'm fine. Penny's fine, the guy she's kissing is really fine and...」
Howard:「Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French?」
Leonard:「What is wrong with you?」
Howard:「I'm a romantic.」
Sheldon:「Please don't tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.」
Leonard:「No, I'm not jealous, I'm just a little concerned for her. I didn't like the look of the guy that she was with.」
Howard:「Because he looks better than you?」
Leonard:「Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.」
Sheldon:「Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you don't crash into geek mountain again.」
Howard:「I disagree, love is not a sprint, it's a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray.」
Leonard:「Well, I'm done with Penny. I'm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed.」
Raj:「Like who?」
Leonard:「I don't know. Olivia Geiger?」
Sheldon:「The dietitian at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?」
Leonard:「Yeah.」
Sheldon:「Well, I don't think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Leslie Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability.」
