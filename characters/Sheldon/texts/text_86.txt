'''Scene''':「''Outside Howard’s house.''」
Leonard:「Sheldon, think this through, you're going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo.」
Sheldon:「No, I'm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems.」
Leonard:「You're right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms, and human contact.」
Sheldon:「My point.」
