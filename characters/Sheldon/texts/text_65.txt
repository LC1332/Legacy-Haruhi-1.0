Girl in Butterfly Costume:「''(Dropping onto sofa next to Raj)'' How wasted am I? ''(Raj shrugs.)''」
Sheldon:「Neeeeeooooowwwwww!」
Girl:「I still don't get it.」
Sheldon:「I'm the Doppler Effect.」
Girl:「Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it's very insensitive.」
Leonard:「Why don't you just tell people you're a zebra?」
Sheldon:「Well, why don't you just tell people you're one of the seven dwarves.」
Leonard:「Because I'm Frodo.」
Sheldon:「Yes, well, I'm the Doppler Effect.」
Leonard:「Oh no.」
Sheldon:「What?」
Leonard:「That's Penny's ex-boyfriend.」
Sheldon:「What do you suppose he's doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field.」
Leonard:「If he were any bigger, he'd have moons orbiting him.」
Sheldon:「Oh, snap. So I guess we'll be leaving now.」
Leonard:「Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn't even want him here. ''(Penny and Kurt hug)''.」
Sheldon:「You have a back-up hypothesis.」
Leonard:「Maybe they just want to be friends.」
Sheldon:「Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more.」
Leonard:「Then he and I are on equal ground.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but you're much closer to it than he is.」
Leonard:「Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.」
Sheldon:「And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy.」
Leonard:「Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn't have to back down.」
Sheldon:「True. Why don't you text him that and see if he backs down?」
Leonard:「No. I'm going to assert my dominance face to face.」
Sheldon:「Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?」
Leonard:「Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.」
Penny:「Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?」
Sheldon:「Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system.」
[[Kurt]]:「What, you're a zebra, right?」
Sheldon:「Yet another child left behind.」
