Leonard:「Oh, uh, he'll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they're one on one and smell nice.」
Penny:「Oh, thanks Raj, it's vanilla oil.」
Leonard:「I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let's just start.」
Penny:「Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.」
Sheldon:「And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.」
Penny:「That is correct.」
Leonard:「I knew that too.」
Penny:「Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.」
Sheldon:「And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.」
Penny:「Right.」
Howard:「Hey, I buzzed in.」
Sheldon:「But I answered, it's called teamwork.」
Howard:「Don't you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.」
Sheldon:「By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I'm a mammal.」
Leonard:「Just ask another one.」
Penny:「Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? ''(Raj buzzes.)''」
Sheldon:「And of course it's Gravity Probe B.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer.」
Sheldon:「Why?」
Penny:「Because it's polite.」
Sheldon:「What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?」
Penny:「Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions.」
Sheldon:「The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn't I give them?」
Howard:「Some of us might have the correct answers too.」
Sheldon:「Oh please, you don't even have a PhD.」
Howard:「Alright, that's it.」
Leonard:「Howard, sit down.」
Howard:「Okay.」
Leonard:「maybe we should take a little break.」
Sheldon:「Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury.」
