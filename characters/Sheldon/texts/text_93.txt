Raj:「Spring wedding?」
Mrs. Koothrappali:「It's up to you dear, we don't want to meddle.」
Raj:「If you don't want to meddle, then why are you meddling?」
Sheldon:「If I may, your parents probably don't consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their children's lives.」
Raj:「Why are you telling me about my own culture?」
Sheldon:「You seemed confused.」
