Leonard:「Actually, Penny, he's Rob...」
Howard:「I'm Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.」
Penny:「No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.」
Leonard:「Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.」
Sheldon:「Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.」
Penny:「Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.」
Leonard:「Okay.」
Sheldon:「See, people get it.」
Raj:「Mmmm, by Odin's beard, this is good Chex Mix.」
Howard:「No thanks, peanuts, I can't afford to swell up in these tights.」
Sheldon:「I'm confused. If there's no costume parade, what are we doing here?」
Leonard:「We’re socialising. Meeting new people.」
Sheldon:「Telepathically?」
Penny:「''(Crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen)'' Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!」
Raj:「Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry's.」
Leonard:「She's not Catwoman, she's just a generic cat.」
Sheldon:「And that's the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.」
