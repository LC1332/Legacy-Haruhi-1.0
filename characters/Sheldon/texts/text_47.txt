Sheldon:「This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives.」
Penny:「Thank you.」
Sheldon:「No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes.」
Penny:「Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didn't you say you needed some eggs.」
Sheldon:「Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket.」
Penny:「Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then.」
Sheldon:「No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think you'll really enjoy this, is, they're shelved with the vegetables, but they're technically a fruit.」
Penny:「Interesting.」
Sheldon:「Isn't it?」
Penny:「No, I mean what you find enjoyable.」
Sheldon:「''(As Penny selects vitamin supplements)'' Oh boy.」
Penny:「What now?」
Sheldon:「Well, there's some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine.」
Penny:「Well, maybe that's what I was going for.」
Sheldon:「Well then you'll want some manganese.」
