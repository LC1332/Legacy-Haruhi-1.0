'''Scene''':「''Penny’s apartment, penny is sleeping, Sheldon is cleaning. Leonard enters.''」
Leonard:「Sheldon!」
Sheldon:「Sssshhhh! Penny's sleeping.」
Leonard:「Are you insane? You can't just break into a woman's apartment in the middle of the night and clean.」
Sheldon:「I had no choice. I couldn't sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway was... this.」
Leonard:「Do you realize that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why we’re here?」
Sheldon:「I just gave you a reasonable explanation.」
Leonard:「No, no. You gave me an explanation, it's reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers.」
Sheldon:「Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, we have to get out of here.」
Sheldon:「You might want to speak in a lower register.」
Leonard:「What?」
Sheldon:「Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that they'll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register.」
Leonard:「That's ridiculous. ''(Penny snores again.)''」
Sheldon:「No, ''(lowering his voice dramatically,)'' that's ridiculous.」
Leonard:「align="left" |''(Doing likewise)'' Fine. I accept your premise, now please let's go.」
Sheldon:「I am not leaving until I'm done.」
Leonard:「O-o-o-oh! ''(Collapses against wall).''」
Sheldon:「If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.」
