Penny:「Oh, my God, what happened?」
Leonard:「Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.」
Penny:「I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.」
Leonard:「No, it was a valid hypothesis.」
Sheldon:「That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?」
Penny:「Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?」
Leonard:「Really? Great.」
Sheldon:「Thank you. You're not done with her, are you?」
Leonard:「Our babies will be smart and beautiful.」
Sheldon:「Not to mention imaginary.」
