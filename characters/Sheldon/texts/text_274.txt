Sheldon:「Oh, there's my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, weren't you, you little subatomic Dickens?」
Leonard:「Hi Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino.」
Howard:「Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons.」
Leonard:「Well, we’re going to go apologize to Raj and invite him out to dinner.」
Sheldon:「Apologize, for what?」
Leonard:「Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we weren't very supportive.」
Sheldon:「I sense you're trying to tell me something.」
Howard:「You were a colossal ass-hat.」
Sheldon:「Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive.」
Leonard:「Really, do tell.」
Sheldon:「How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a “world’s greatest dad” coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died.」
Leonard:「Okay, let's try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?」
Sheldon:「I had not considered that.」
Leonard:「Come on.」
Sheldon:「I often forget other people have limitations. It's so sad.」
