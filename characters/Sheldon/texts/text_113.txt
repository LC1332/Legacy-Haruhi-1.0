Sheldon:「You could have offered me a ride home.」
Leonard:「You're lucky I didn't run you over.」
Sheldon:「I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, there's just no pleasing you.」
Leonard:「You're right, I'm the problem, I'm the one that needs help.」
Sheldon:「Well that's not much of an apology, but I'll take it.」
Leonard:「Excuse me. Is there anything you'd like to apologize for?」
Sheldon:「Yes. I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for.」
Howard:「''(Entering with Raj)'' You won't believe this.」
Raj:「Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on YouTube.」
Leonard:「What?」
Sheldon:「Now, who would do that?」
Howard:「That would be me. Hey, check it out, it's a featured video. ''(They watch)''.」
Leonard:「Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?」
Sheldon:「Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.」
