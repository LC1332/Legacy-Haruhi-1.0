Leonard:「I'm coming! ''(Opens the door. Sheldon falls inside, wearing his pajamas. Howard is outside.)''」
Sheldon:「Hey, there he is, there's my old buddy-bud-bud.」
Leonard:「What's with him?」
Howard:「Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldn't get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my mom's valium in it. But he still wouldn't shut up, so, tag, you're it.」
Sheldon:「I'm ba-ack!」
Leonard:「I still don't know why you left.」
Sheldon:「I can't tell you.」
Leonard:「Why not.」
Sheldon:「I promised Penny.」
Leonard:「You promised Penny what?」
Sheldon:「That I wouldn't tell you the secret. Shhhhh!」
Leonard:「What secret. Tell me the secret.」
Sheldon:「Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we can't tell Dad.」
Leonard:「Not that secret, the other secret.」
Sheldon:「I'm Batman. Shhhhh!」
Leonard:「Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret.」
Sheldon:「Okay, I'll tell you, but you can't tell Leonard.」
Leonard:「I promise.」
Sheldon:「Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid she's not smart enough for Leonard.」
Leonard:「So it's nothing I did? It's her problem?」
Sheldon:「I drank milk that tasted funny.」
Leonard:「Penny thinks I'm too smart for her, that's ridiculous.」
Sheldon:「I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Don't worry, that's not a secret. Everybody knows.」
