'''Scene''':「''Leonard’s bedroom. The bedside table is piled with Queen Mary memorabilia.''」
Sheldon:「''(Knock, knock, knock, knock)'' Leonard, ''(Knock, knock, knock, knock)'' Leonard, ''(Knock, knock, knock, knock)'' Leonard...」
Leonard:「Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not.」
Sheldon:「No, that's the least of our worries. I’ve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioral aspects, and I think there's a problem with the current version of our lie.」
Leonard:「What are you talking about, it's fine, she bought it, it's over.」
Sheldon:「Sadly, it's not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realized that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab.」
Leonard:「Why not?」
Sheldon:「Because Leo is a middle child.」
Leonard:「There is no Leo, how can you say that?」
Sheldon:「You didn't read the bio, did you? He's not just a middle child, he's the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab.」
Leonard:「I’ve got a solution.」
Sheldon:「Great, what is it?」
Leonard:「Get out.」
Sheldon:「Fine. ''(He leaves. A moment later he comes back.)'' I’ve hesitated to point this out, but I must now remind you that we are in our current predicament because of your initial and totally inadequate deceit. I'm just trying to clean up after your mess. ''(Leonard throws a glass ornament at him. He just manages to shut the door in time.)'' We'll talk in the morning.」
