Howard:「Do I get an honorable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.」
Raj:「Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars.」
Howard:「Poverty? Your father's a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley.」
Raj:「It's a lease.」
Sheldon:「I'm confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?」
Raj:「Peer review? It's People magazine. People picked me.」
Sheldon:「What people?」
Raj:「The people from People.」
Sheldon:「Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock that's been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?」
Raj:「Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends aren't giving her this kind of crap.」
Leonard:「Are you proud of yourself?」
Sheldon:「In general, yes.」
