Leonard:「''(Pushes buzzer) ''I'll do the talking.」
Voice from buzzer:「Yeah.」
Leonard:「Hi, I'm Leonard, this is Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Hello.」
Leonard:「What did I just.... Uh, we’re here to pick up Penny's TV.」
Voice:「Get lost.」
Sheldon:「Okay, thanks for your time.」
Leonard:「We’re not going to give up just like that.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, the TV is in the building, we’ve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done.」
Leonard:「Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang.」
Sheldon:「My apologies. What's your plan.」
:「''(Leonard starts rattling the doors violently.)''」
Sheldon:「It's just a privilege to watch your mind at work.」
Leonard:「Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building.」
:「''(Two girl scouts arrive carrying bags of cookies. One runs her hand down the intercom, pushing all the buttons. The door is buzzed open.)''」
Sheldon:「What do you think their combined IQ is?」
