Leonard:「If the wedding's not until tomorrow, why don't you stay with us tonight?」
Missy:「Oh, I don't think so. Shelly doesn't like company. Even as a little boy he'd send his imaginary friends home at the end of the day.」
Sheldon:「They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues.」
Leonard:「Look, you're here, we have plenty of room.」
Sheldon:「No we don't.」
Howard:「Come on, Shelly, she's family.」
Sheldon:「So what? I don't issue invitations to your mother.」
Missy:「Well it would be nice not to have to drive out to Anaheim in rush hour.」
Sheldon:「And don't ever call me Shelly.」
Leonard:「So it's settled. You'll stay with us.」
Howard:「I'll walk you to your car. You're in structure 3 level C, right?」
Sheldon:「What just happened?」
