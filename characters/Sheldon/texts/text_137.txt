Sheldon:「Here's the problem with teleportation.」
Leonard:「Lay it on me.」
Sheldon:「Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.」
Leonard:「How about that.」
Sheldon:「Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.」
Leonard:「Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「No, he would be exactly the same.」
Leonard:「That is a problem.」
Sheldon:「So, you see it too.」
