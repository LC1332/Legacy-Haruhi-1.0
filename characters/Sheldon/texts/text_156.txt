Howard:「How about the perpetual motion squad? It's beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies.」
Leonard:「The ladies?」
Howard:「Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.」
Raj:「I like it.」
Sheldon:「I don't. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.」
Raj:「Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.」
Sheldon:「Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant.」
Raj:「Maybe so. But you can't incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass.」
Leonard:「Let's put it to a vote. All those in favour....」
Sheldon:「Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the Bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant.」
Leonard:「Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question?」
Sheldon:「I will yield.」
Leonard:「After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?」
Sheldon:「He does.」
