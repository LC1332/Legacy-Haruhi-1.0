Leonard:「Hello.」
Man:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, this is Tom.」
Leonard:「Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn't I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?」
Sheldon:「Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.」
Leonard:「Chosen by science?」
Sheldon:「Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.」
Leonard:「You got Penny to sign up for online dating?」
Sheldon:「No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.」
Leonard:「This is bad.」
Sheldon:「Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he's going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.」
Leonard:「Really, really bad.」
Sheldon:「I'm surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she's a big old five.」
Penny:「''(Entering, looking ratty in baggy clothes and with her hair unwashed)'' Sheldon, what do you want.」
Sheldon:「Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I'd like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.」
[[Tom]]:「Hi Penny.」
Penny:「Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I'm here, I'm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don't know what they're doing, we’ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.」
Sheldon:「Can we talk about this later.」
Penny:「No, no, no, no, I need you now.」
Sheldon:「But wouldn't you prefer to socialize with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.」
