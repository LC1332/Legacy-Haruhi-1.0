Howard:「Sheldon.」
Raj:「Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.」
Penny:「Sheldon. I'm just going to sit down.」
Leonard:「So, is that your team.」
Sheldon:「Actually, I don't need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?」
Leslie:「Hello, Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Leslie Winkle?」
Leslie:「Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl?」
Sheldon:「Yes, well, I'm polymerised tree sap and you're non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.」
