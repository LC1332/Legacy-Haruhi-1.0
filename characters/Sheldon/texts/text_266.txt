'''Scene''':「The apartment. Sheldon enters.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she's interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I'm sure she'd be interfering with that too.」
Leonard:「Why should I do something, you're the one who introduced her to online gaming.」
Sheldon:「Well, yes, but you're the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you'd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.」
Leonard:「Why don't you just tell her to leave you alone.」
Sheldon:「I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my Facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don't know what else to do.」
Leonard:「Well, what am I supposed to do?」
Sheldon:「I don't know, but if you don't figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.」
Leonard:「You mean, up until now we’ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「Yes.」
