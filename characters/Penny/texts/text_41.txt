Leonard:「I think we’re all talking to Penny here.」
Sheldon:「I'm not. No offence.」
Kurt:「Okay, maybe you didn't hear me, go away.」
Penny:「Alright Kurt, be nice.」
Kurt:「Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.」
Penny:「Kurt!」
Leonard:「Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can't compete with me on an intellectual level and so you're driven to animalistic puffery.」
Kurt:「Are you calling me a puffy animal?」
Penny:「Of course not, no, he's not, you're not, right Leonard?」
