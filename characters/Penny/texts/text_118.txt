Sheldon:「Don't forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so you'd have an excuse to talk to her.」
Leonard:「Oh, right, right right right right.」
Howard:「Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it.」
Leonard:「''(Exiting to hallway)'' Penny, the mail man did it again, he... ''(looks up to see Penny kissing a hunky man)'' Oh! Sorry.」

[[Doug]]:「What's up bro?」
Leonard:「Not much. Bro.」
Penny:「Is, is everything okay.」
Leonard:「Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here.」
Penny:「Thank you, I’ve got to talk to that mail man.」

Penny:「Okay, well, thank you, again.」
