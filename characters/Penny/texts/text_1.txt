Sheldon:「Chat? We don't chat. At least not offline.」
Leonard:「Well it's not difficult, you just listen to what she says, and then you say something appropriate in response.」
Sheldon:「To what end?」
Leonard:「Hi. Again.」
Penny:「Hi.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
Penny:「Hi.」
Leonard:「Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when I'm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I don't have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about.」
Sheldon:「Leonard, I'm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements.」
Penny:「Oh, you're inviting me over to eat?」
Leonard:「Uh, yes.」
Penny:「Oh, that's so nice, I'd love to.」
Leonard:「Great.」
Penny:「So, what do you guys do for fun around here?」
