Leonard:「Okay. I'll let you get back to fixing your eggs.」
Sheldon:「I'm not just fixing my eggs, I'm fixing everyone's eggs.」
Leonard:「And we all thank you.」
Sheldon:「Use new eggs. ''(There is a knock on the door).''」
Penny:「''(Popping her head round)'' Hi, hey. I'm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?」
Sheldon:「Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence.」
Penny:「I'm sorry?」
Sheldon:「I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.」
Penny:「Four dozen?」
Sheldon:「Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo.」
Penny:「Okay, one more time?」
Sheldon:「Never mind, you won't get it right, I'd better come with you.」
Penny:「Oh, yay!」
