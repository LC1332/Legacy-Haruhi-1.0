'''Scene''':「Penny's apartment. She is on her laptop and talking into a headset.」
Penny:「No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don't know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!」
Leonard:「''(Knocking and entering)'' Hey Penny.」
Penny:「Busy.」
Leonard:「Yeah, I see that. Shouldn't you be at work?」
Penny:「I don't work on Mondays.」
Leonard:「It's Thursday. Listen, Penny.」
Penny:「Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?」
Leonard:「Okay, um, here's the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.」
Penny:「Yeah, get to the point, I'm about to level up here.」
Leonard:「Well, i-i-i-it's just if a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.」
Penny:「Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope's back online.」
Leonard:「Penny, you've got cheetos in your hair.」
Penny:「''(Pulling cheeto out of hair)'' Oh, thanks. ''(Eats it.)''」
