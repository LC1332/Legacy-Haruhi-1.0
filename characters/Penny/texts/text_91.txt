Raj:「Ooh, how far into the future?」
Sheldon:「If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10, 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.」
Leonard:「Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10, 2328. Here we go into the future. ''(Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.)'' That was fun.」
Raj:「My turn.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.」
Leonard:「Are you okay?」
Penny:「Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch.」
Leonard:「That doesn't sound too bad.」
Penny:「It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.」
Leonard:「Sorry.」
Penny:「Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they’d given my shift away. Yeah, that's right, I’ve lost an entire day's pay thanks to this... this...」
Sheldon:「Time machine.」
Leonard:「The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?」
Penny:「No! I don't want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and... and now that... that...」
Sheldon:「Again, time machine.」
Penny:「Oh please, it's not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.」
Sheldon:「It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp.」
Penny:「Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. ''(Storms out. A beat, and then…)''」
