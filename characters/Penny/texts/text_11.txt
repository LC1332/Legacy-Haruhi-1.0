Leonard:「Here we go.」
Sheldon:「Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they don't actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth.」
Leonard:「Ask him for a napkin, I dare you. ''(There is a knock on the door.)'' I'll get it.」
Howard:「Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.」
Penny:「Hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Oh, hi Penny.」
Penny:「Am I interrupting?」
Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「''(Off)'' You're not swelling, Howard.」
Howard:「''(Off)'' No, no, look at my fingers, they're like Vienna sausages!」
Penny:「Sounds like you have company.」
Leonard:「They're not going anywhere. ''(Closes door, staying in hallway.)'' So, you're coming home from work. That's great. How was work?」
Penny:「Well, you know, it's the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them.」
Leonard:「So, you kind of act as like a carbohydrate delivery system.」
Penny:「Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I was....」
Leonard:「Yes.」
Penny:「Oh. Okay, great, I'm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, so.... ''(apartment door opens, Sheldon, Raj and Howard appear)'' Oh! Hel...hello!」
Howard:「''(Speaks a phrase "You are a very beautiful girl" in Russian).''」
Penny:「I'm sorry?」
Howard:「Haven't you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?」
Penny:「No, I haven't.」
Howard:「Get used to it.」
Penny:「Yeah, I probably won't, but... Hey Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Hi.」
Penny:「Hey Raj! ''(Raj looks uncomfortable)'' Still not talking to me, huh?」
Sheldon:「Don't take it personally, it's his pathology, he can't talk to women.」
Howard:「He can't talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake–scented Goddess!」
Leonard:「So, there's gonna be some furniture delivered?」
Penny:「Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and I'm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment.」
Leonard:「Yeah, no problem.」
Penny:「Great, here's my spare key. Thank you.」
Leonard:「Penny, wait.」
Penny:「Yeah?」
Leonard:「Um, if you don't have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?」
Penny:「A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?」
Sheldon:「You're kidding, right?」
Penny:「Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that?」
Leonard, Sheldon and Howard:「One. ''(Raj raises one finger).''」
Sheldon:「You realize that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.」
Penny:「Yes, I know, men can't fly.」
