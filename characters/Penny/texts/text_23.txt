Sheldon:「Alright, I'm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg.」
Howard:「Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla.」
Leonard:「No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk.」
Raj:「Why don't you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.」
Penny:「Hi, you guys ready to order?」
Howard:「Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?」
Leonard:「And Orcs!」
Penny:「I'll be back.」
Raj:「Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps.」
Penny:「Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back.」
Howard:「What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?」
Penny:「A shower.」
Howard:「I'll take the heart smart platter.」
Penny:「Alright, thank you, and Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「We don't eat here, I don't know what's good.」
Penny:「Well, it's all good.」
Sheldon:「Statistically unlikely.」
Leonard:「Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers.」
Sheldon:「I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you can't make the assumption that I'll like the hamburgers here.」
Leonard:「I'm sorry. Give him a hamburger.」
Penny:「Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?」
Sheldon:「Can't we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy.」
Penny:「The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy.」
Sheldon:「Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?」
Penny:「Because you are not at Big Boy!」
