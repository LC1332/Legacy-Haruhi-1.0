'''Scene''':「The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny's door with his bow.」
Howard:「Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I’ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver.」
Penny:「''(Opening door, not in costume)'' Oh, hey guys.」
Leonard:「Hey, sorry we’re late.」
Penny:「Late? It's 7」
Sheldon:「And you said the party starts at seven.」
Penny:「Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven.」
Sheldon:「It's 7」
Penny:「Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in.」
Howard:「What, are all the girls in the bathroom?」
Penny:「Probably, but in their own homes.」
Sheldon:「So what time does the costume parade start?」
Penny:「The parade?」
Sheldon:「Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.」
Penny:「Oh, Sheldon, I'm sorry but there aren't going to be any parades or judges or prizes.」
Sheldon:「This party is just going to suck.」
Penny:「No, come on, it's going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that's so cute.」
Leonard:「Actually, Penny, he's Rob...」
Howard:「I'm Peter Pan! And I’ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it.」
Penny:「No you don't. Oh, hey, what's Sheldon supposed to be.」
Leonard:「Oh, he's the Doppler Effect.」
Sheldon:「Yes. It's the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer.」
Penny:「Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I’ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable.」
