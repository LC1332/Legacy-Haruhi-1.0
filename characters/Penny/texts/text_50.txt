Leonard:「Penny's still sleeping.」
Sheldon:「Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal...」
Leonard:「I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why don't you just have breakfast in bed?」
Sheldon:「Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.」
Penny:「Uh, what time is it?」
Leonard:「Almost 6:30.」
Penny:「I slept all day?」
Leonard:「Oh, no, it's 6:30 in the morning.」
Penny:「What the hell is your problem?」
Sheldon:「Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste.」
Howard:「''(Entering)'' Hola, nerd-migos.」
Penny:「Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?」
Howard:「Oh, yeah, sorry, I'll have it cleaned.」
Penny:「That's okay, keep it. Where's Christy.」
Howard:「In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt? Yours reaches places that mine just won't.」
Penny:「Y-you used my loofah?」
Howard:「More precisely ''we'' used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out!」
Penny:「You can keep that too.」
