Sheldon:「We could put her stereo back there.」
Leonard:「And control it how?」
Sheldon:「Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy.」
Howard:「align="left" |''(After Raj whispers in his ear)'' Good point, how you gonna cool it?」
Penny:「Hey guys, I got this.」
Sheldon:「Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?」
Leonard:「Also inefficient, and might be loud.」
Howard:「How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVC...」
Penny:「Guys, this is actually really simple.」
Howard:「Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.」
Leonard:「Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?」
Sheldon:「And if water is involved we’re going to have to ground the crap out of the thing.」
Penny:「Guys, it's hot in here, I think I'll just take off all my clothes.」
