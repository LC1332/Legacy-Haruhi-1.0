Leonard:「Why at my place?」
Lesley:「Yeah, the department of energy said our regular space is kind of a hot zone. Nice meeting you.」
Penny:「Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didn't know you played the cello?」
Leonard:「Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasn't getting me beaten up enough.」
Howard:「If you're into music, I happen to be a human beatbox.」
Penny:「Really? ''(Howard performs some of the worst beatboxing imaginable.)'' I'm actually not that into music. So hey, your friend's really cute, anything going on with you two.」
Leonard:「Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?」
Sheldon:「He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure.」
Leonard:「Thank you Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Oh, I'm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?」
Penny:「Oh, that's too bad, you guys would make a cute couple.」
