'''Scene''':「''A restaurant.''」
Penny:「So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?」
Leonard:「Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.」
Penny:「Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy.」
Leonard:「You're kidding, well, then, that's something we have in common.」
Penny:「How?」
Leonard:「We both have people in our lives who... want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud.」
Penny:「So, what's new in the world of physics?」
Leonard:「Nothing.」
Penny:「Really, nothing?」
Leonard:「Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930s, and you can't prove string theory, at best you can say “hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.”」
Penny:「Ah. Well I'm sure things will pick up.」
Leonard:「What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?」
Penny:「Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime that's moving pretty well.」
Leonard:「Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend.」
Penny:「Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, you know, he's nice and funny, but...」
Waitress:「Can I get you started with some drinks?」
Leonard:「No, ''(waves her away)'' You were saying, but...」
Penny:「I'd like a drink.」
Leonard:「Just say the but thing about Doug and then I'll get her back.」
Penny:「Okay, well, you know, it's just me. I'm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex.」
Leonard:「Ugh, don't get me started on rebound sex.」
Penny:「It's just, it's my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then it's just thirty six meaningless hours of... well, you know.」
Leonard:「I'm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, one... glorious summer.」
Penny:「No, it's usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it.」
Leonard:「Well, chafing, right?」
Penny:「Emotionally.」
Leonard:「Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool? ''(Penny nods.)'' I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it.」
Penny:「How?」
Leonard:「Physics. ''(He places the glass over the olive and spins it until the olive gets caught up on the side)''.」
Penny:「Wow, centrifugal force!」
Leonard:「Actually, it's centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive.'' (The olive drops.)'' Excuse me. ''(Leonard disappears under table.)''Now, if you were riding on the olive, you'd be in a non-inertial reference frame, and would ''(he bangs his head on the underside of the table.)''」
Penny:「Are you okay?」
Leonard:「Yeah, I'm okay. Did you spill ketchup?」
Penny:「No.」
