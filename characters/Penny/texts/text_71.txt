Sheldon:「No. We’re going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production.」
Toby:「Swell, how do I play genetic predisposition?」
Sheldon:「Subtextually, of course. ''(There is a knock on the door.)'' Just have fun with it. ''(Opening door.)'' Morning Penny.」
Penny:「Hi. How did the intervention go.」
Sheldon:「Unfortunately, we weren't able to convince him to go to rehab.」
Penny:「Well, based on what you told me, I'm not surprised.」
Sheldon:「But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbor.」
Penny:「Hi Leo, how are you feeling?」
Toby:「Let me ask you something, Penny. Have you ever woken up in a fleabag motel, covered in your own vomit, next to a transsexual prostitute?」
Penny:「No.」
Toby:「Then don't ask me how I'm feeling.」
Leonard:「Well, that's Leo. Hey, um, why don't you tell me about your showcase last night?」
Penny:「Oh, it was okay I guess, wasn't a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it.」
Leonard:「There were only two people there?」
Penny:「By the end. Yeah.」
Toby:「Damn you, Chaplain Horrigan!」
Penny:「I'm... I'm sorry.」
