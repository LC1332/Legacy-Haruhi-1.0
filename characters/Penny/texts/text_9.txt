'''Scene''':「''Inside Sheldon and Leonard’s apartment.''」
Howard:「This is one of my favorite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale.」
Penny:「Wow, cool tiger.」
Howard:「Yeah, I’ve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest.」
Penny:「Uh, sounds interesting.」
Howard:「So you'll think about it?」
Penny:「Oh, I don't think I'll be able to stop thinking about it.」
Raj:「Smooth.」
Leonard:「We’re home.」
Penny:「Oh, my God, what happened?」
Leonard:「Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.」
Penny:「I'm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.」
Leonard:「No, it was a valid hypothesis.」
Sheldon:「That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?」
Penny:「Really, thank you so much for going and trying you're, uh, you're so terrific. Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?」
