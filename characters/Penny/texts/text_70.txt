Leonard:「I don't know what to say.」
Howard:「Wow.」
Leonard:「Howard, listen...」
Howard:「No, it's okay, it's your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening.」
Penny:「Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them.」
Sheldon:「Okay, sure. I don't see a problem with that.」
Penny:「There's no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isn't that right Leonard.」
Leonard:「Well... I don't know what to say.」
Penny:「It's okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farm...ian」
Sheldon:「Good for you.」
Penny:「Hah, yeah! Because he didn't want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner.」
Howard:「''(After Raj whispers in his ear)'' No, I'm lost too, I think she skipped a step.」
Penny:「No, look, Sheldon's cousin Leo escaped rehab, and he's in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole family's going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because he's such a good man.」
Leonard:「Oh, another hug, thank you.」
Penny:「Alright you guys, good luck.」
