'''Scene''':「''Outside Penny’s door. Leonard knocks.''」
Penny:「''(Answering)'' Oh, hey guys, what's up?」
Sheldon:「It's Halo night.」
Penny:「Yeah. Okay. So?」
Leonard:「Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christy,」
Penny:「She's not my friend. Friends do not get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.」
Leonard:「Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I don't think I need to tell you what an honor this is.」
Penny:「Oh, that's so sweet. But I'm going out dancing with a girlfriend.」
Sheldon:「You can't go out, it's Halo night.」
Penny:「Well, for Penny it's dancing night.」
Sheldon:「You go dancing every Wednesday?」
Penny:「No.」
Sheldon:「Then it's not dancing night.」
Penny:「Look, why don't I play with you guys tomorrow?」
Sheldon:「Tonight is Halo night! It's like talking to a wall.」
Penny:「Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem.」
Leonard:「Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.」
Sheldon:「Yes, but you didn't portray her as completely irrational.」
Penny:「Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck.」
