Leonard:「So you see, what you're eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesn't have enough live acidophilus cultures. It's really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness.」
Penny:「Oh, that's very interesting.」
Leonard:「It's also not pink and has no berries.」
Penny:「Yeah, but it doesn't really answer my question.」
Leonard:「What was your question again?」
Penny:「Do you want some.」
Leonard:「Oh, right, no, I'm lactose intolerant.」
Penny:「Right.」
Leonard:「So, gas.」
Penny:「Got it.」
Leonard:「Well, good night. ''(They kiss. Camera cuts away to a wall mounted security cam above the lift. Leonard spots its movement and shuffles Penny away.)''」
Penny:「What are you doing?」
Leonard:「There was a draft.」
Penny:「I didn't feel a draft.」
Leonard:「Why don't we just go into your....」
Penny:「Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little.」
Leonard:「No, no, I didn't mean to go into your apartment to... go fast.」
Penny:「No, I know, I... I know what you meant, it's just... it's only our first date.」
Leonard:「Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why don't we just figure out where we’re going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R.」
Penny:「Or we could just wing it.」
Leonard:「That might work too.」
Penny:「Goodnight Leonard.」
