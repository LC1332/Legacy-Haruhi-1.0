:「Time shift. View of a mobile phone video screen. Raj has a woman sitting on his shoulders.」
Raj:「Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I don't know where you are dude, but it's really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uh... ''(girl pours booze into his mouth)'' Oh look, there's a girl taking her shirt off.」
Penny:「That's my friend Carol. Remind me, I’ve got to introduce her to Howard.」
Raj:「Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker.」
Penny:「I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.」
Leonard:「Oh, it's okay.」
Penny:「Happy birthday anyways. ''(She kisses him full on the lips.)''」
