Howard:「Ha-ha, not your eyebrows?」
Missy:「Yep. I had to go through the entire second grade with crooked eyebrows my Mom drew on.」
Sheldon:「Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical.」
Penny:「''(Knocking and entering, holding up a pair of superman undershorts.)'' Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs.」
Leonard:「Those are not mine.」
Penny:「Really, they have your little name label in them.」
Leonard:「Yeah, no, I do, I use those... uh... just to polish up my... spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When I'm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldon's twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbor Penny.」
Missy:「Hi.」
Penny:「Wow, you don't look that much alike.」
Howard:「Can I get a hallelujah.」
Sheldon:「Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings.」
Howard:「Hallelujah.」
Raj:「''(Running in)''Hey, guess what. I’ve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness.」
Penny:「Hey, good for you, Raj.」
