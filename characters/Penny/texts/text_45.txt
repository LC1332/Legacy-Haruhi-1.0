Raj:「We can split it two, two and two.」
Howard:「If we’re having anchovies on the pizza we can't take it out of bathroom time. ''(There is a knock on the door.)''」
Sheldon:「Oh, what fresh hell is this?」
Leonard:「''(Opening door)'' Hey Penny, come on in.」
Penny:「Hey guys.」
Howard:「See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day you'll have good luck.」
Penny:「No you won't. Uh, can I hide out here for a while.」
Leonard:「Sure. What's going on?」
Penny:「Well, there's this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christy. Well, anyway, she called me up and she's like “Hey, how’s California,” and I'm like “Awesome” ‘cause, you know, it's not Nebraska, and the next thing I know she's invited herself out here to stay with me.」
Sheldon:「8:08.」
Penny:「Anyway, she got here today, and she's just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy she's slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink.」
Howard:「Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?」
Penny:「He really needs to dial it down.」
Leonard:「So, if you don't like this Christy, why are you letting her stay?」
Penny:「Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so she's kind of family.」
Sheldon:「You know, I apologize for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?」
Leonard:「Oh, I don't think she's a whore.」
Penny:「No, yeah she's definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was at... Where's Howard?」
