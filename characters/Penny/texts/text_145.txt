Sheldon:「There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. (Smiles)」
Penny:「Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly.」
