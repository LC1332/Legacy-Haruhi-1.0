Sheldon:「I.e, I couldn't become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman.」
Leonard:「You could be Batman?」
Sheldon:「Sure. ''(In a gravelly voice)'' I'm Batman. See.」
Penny:「''(Arriving)'' Hi guys.」
Leonard:「Hey.」
Sheldon:「''(Looking the other way uncomfortably)'' Hi Penny.」
Leonard:「Hey, Penny, if you're not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie.」
Penny:「Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday.」
Leonard:「What about Saturday?」
Penny:「You know, I'm not sure, the manager hasn't posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know.」
