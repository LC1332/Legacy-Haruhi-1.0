Sheldon:「Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Superman's flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from exposure to Earth's yellow Sun.」

Sheldon:「Uh, a combination of the moon's solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells.」
Penny:「I'm just going to go wash up.」
