Leonard:「Sheldon, get out of my way.」
Sheldon:「''(Brandishing toy sword from Leonard’s box)'' None shall pass.」
Leonard:「Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek:  The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it.」
Howard:「Okay man, be cool, we’re all friends here.」
Penny:「''(Coming out of her flat)'' What the hell's going on?」
Sheldon:「You hypocrite!」
Penny:「What?」
Sheldon:「Little Miss “grown ups don’t play with toys”. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty!」
Penny:「Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.」
Leonard:「No, I needed to hear it.」
Penny:「No you didn't. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are.」
Howard:「I guess that makes me large breasts.」
Leonard:「Still, I think it's time for me to get rid of this stuff and... you know... move on with my life.」
Penny:「Really?」
Leonard:「Yeah.」
Penny:「Oh. Wow. Good for you. ''(Kisses his cheek.)''」
Leonard:「Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don't know, later...」
Good looking man coming up stairs:「Excuse me. Hey, Penny!」
Penny:「Hi Mike.」
[[Mike (Season 1)|Mike]]:「Are you ready to go.」
Penny:「Yeah, I just have to change.」
Mike:「I'll give you a hand.」
Penny:「Oh, stop it! Bye guys.」
