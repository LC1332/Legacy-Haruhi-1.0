Leonard:「Yes! For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth.」
Sheldon:「You have a sarcasm sign?」
Leonard:「No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.」
Sheldon:「Do you want some cereal. I'm feeling so good today I'm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs.」
Penny:「align="left" |''(Voice off)'' Son of a Bitch!」
Leonard:「Penny's up.」
Penny:「''(Voice off)'' You sick, geeky bastards!」
Leonard:「How did she know it was us?」
Sheldon:「I may have left a suggested organizational schematic for her bedroom closet.」
Penny:「align="left" |''(Voice off)'' Leonard!」
Leonard:「God, this is going to be bad.」
Sheldon:「Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?」
Leonard:「Yes, but, only to clean.」
Sheldon:「Really more to organize, you're not actually dirty, per se.」
Penny:「Give me back my key.」
Leonard:「I'm very, very sorry.」
Penny:「Do you understand how creepy this is.」
Leonard:「Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night.」
Penny:「In my apartment, while I was sleeping.」
Sheldon:「And snoring. And that's probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. It's a throat doctor.」
Penny:「And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?」
Sheldon:「Depending on the depth, that's either a proctologist or a general surgeon. ''(Leonard holds up a sign reading “Sarcasm”)'' Oh!」
Penny:「God!」
Leonard:「Okay, look, no Penny, I think what you're feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when you're feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more.」
Penny:「Stay away from me.」
