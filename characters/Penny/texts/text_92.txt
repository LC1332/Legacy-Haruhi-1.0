'''Scene''':「''The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.''」
Leonard:「Come on, guys, push.」
Howard:「''(Off)'' If I push any harder I'm going to give birth to my colon.」
Penny:「''(Coming out of her apartment)'' Oh, hey guys.」
Leonard:「''(Letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)'' Uh, hi Penny. ''(Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.)'' Take a break, guys!」
Penny:「What are you doing?」
Leonard:「Oh, just, you know, moving a... time machine.」
Penny:「Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so....」
Leonard:「No problem. ''(Removes glasses, pulls down out of order tape from lift doors, and forces them open.)'' Hang on. ''(Takes Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)''」
Penny:「But, what about your time machine.」
Leonard:「Some things are more important than toys. ''(She puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.)''」
Penny:「Oh, I'm scared.」
Leonard:「Don't worry baby, I’ve got you.」
Penny:「Oh, Leonard. ''(Kisses him as they descend from view. Leonard wakes up still sitting in the time machine.)''」
