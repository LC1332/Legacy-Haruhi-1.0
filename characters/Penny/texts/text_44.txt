Leonard:「No.」
Sheldon:「Good. There there was really all I had.」
Leonard:「Good night Sheldon.」
Sheldon:「Good night Leonard.」
Penny:「''(Knocking on door and entering)'' Hey Leonard.」
Leonard:「Hi Penny.」
Penny:「Hey, I just wanted to make sure you're okay.」
Leonard:「I'm fine.」
Penny:「I'm so sorry about what happened.」
Leonard:「It's not your fault.」
Penny:「Yes it is. That's why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that.」
Leonard:「So why was he at your party?」
Penny:「Well, I ran into him last week and, he was...  just, all apologetic, about how he's changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I'm an idiot because I always believe guys like that and... I can't go back to my party because he's there, and I know you don't want to hear this and I'm upset and I'm really drunk and I just want to... ''(bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard’s shoulder.)''」
Leonard:「There there.」
Penny:「God, what is wrong with me.」
Leonard:「Nothing, you're perfect.」
Penny:「Gah, I'm not perfect.」
Leonard:「Yes you are.」
Penny:「You really think so, don't you? ''(She kisses hm.)''」
Leonard:「Penny?」
Penny:「Yeah.」
Leonard:「How much have you had to drink tonight?」
Penny:「Just.... a lot.」
Leonard:「Are you sure that you're being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn't have something to do with what's going on here?」
Penny:「It might. Boy, you're really smart.」
Leonard:「Yeah, I'm a frickin’ genius.」
Penny:「Leonard, you are so great. Why can't all guys be like you?」
Leonard:「Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn't survive.」
Penny:「I should probably go.」
Leonard:「Probably.」
Penny:「''(In doorway)'' Thank you. ''(She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.)''」
