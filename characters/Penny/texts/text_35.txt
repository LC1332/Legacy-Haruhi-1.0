Howard:「Oh yeah.」
Mary Cooper:「Okay. Alright everybody, it's time to eat. ''(Everybody begins to do so)'' Oh Lord, we thank you for this meal, all your bounty, and we pray that you help Sheldon get back on his rocker. ''(To Raj and Howard)'' Now after a moment of silent meditation I'm going to end with “In Jesus’ Name” but you two don't feel any obligation to join in. Unless, of course, the holy spirit moves you.」
Penny:「Oh my God, this is the best cobbler I’ve ever had.」
Mary Cooper:「It was always Sheldon’ s favorite. You know what the secret ingredient is?」
Penny:「Love?」
