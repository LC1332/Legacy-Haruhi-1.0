'''Scene''':「The entrance lobby. Sheldon is sitting on the bottom step using his laptop. Penny comes down the stairs.」
Penny:「Sheldon? What are you doing?」
Sheldon:「Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.」
Penny:「Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?」
Sheldon:「I'm a modern-day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.」
Penny:「Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why don't you just go to a movie or something?」
Sheldon:「Alone?」
Penny:「Yeah, why not?」
Sheldon:「What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich <span style="color:rgb(35,35,142);font-family:'TimesNewRoman';font-size:medium;line-height:normal;">maneuv</span>er.」
Penny:「Well then don't order popcorn.」
Sheldon:「No popcorn at the mo... listen to yourself.」
Penny:「Well why don't you go to a coffee shop.」
Sheldon:「I don't drink coffee.」
Penny:「They have other things.」
Sheldon:「What do they have?」
Penny:「I don't know, you know, cookies, pastries...」
Sheldon:「Pastries such as bearclaws?」
Penny:「Yeah, sure.」
Sheldon:「I don't like bearclaws.」
Leslie:「''(Entering)'' Heya Penny. Dumbass.」
Sheldon:「Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?」
Penny:「Well, they have a lot in common. I mean they're both scientists.」
Sheldon:「Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.」
Penny:「Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya.」
