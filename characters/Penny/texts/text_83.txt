Sheldon:「Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it's an extremely private matter.」
Leonard:「Still, I'd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn't just conceive.」
Howard:「Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock's dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.」
Raj:「How come on Star Trek everybody's private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose.」
Penny:「''(Entering)'' Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it's just going “aaaaaaa”.」
Leonard:「What did you spill on it?」
Penny:「Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish.」
Leonard:「I'll take a look at it.」
Howard:「Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren't fielding a team in the University Physics Bowl this year.」
Leonard:「You're kidding, why not?」
Howard:「They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsberry Farm.」
Penny:「Wow, so in your world, you're like, the cool guys.」
Howard:「Recognize.」
Leonard:「This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod.」
Penny:「Zod?」
