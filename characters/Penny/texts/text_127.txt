Sheldon:「Oh-ho! Really? Well here's another "nit" for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.」
Howard:「Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy. They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.」
Sheldon:「Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said “huzzah!”」
Howard:「I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation.」
Penny:「''(Arriving with Eric)'' Hi guys. Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair. I'm hoping.」
Sheldon:「Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.」
Penny:「Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.」
Howard:「Hello.」
Leonard:「Hi.」
[[Eric]]:「Hey.」
Leonard:「So, yeah, good to see you.」
Penny:「Yeah, yeah, it's good to see you too. We should really go.」
Eric:「Yeah.」
Penny:「''(Leaving)'' Bye guys.」
