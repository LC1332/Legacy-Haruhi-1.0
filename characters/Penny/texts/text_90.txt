Sheldon:「It's the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.」
Raj:「Sheldon?」
Sheldon:「Yeah.」
Raj:「If my fingers ever work again, I’ve got a job for the middle one.」
Penny:「''(Coming out of her apartment)'' Oh, hey guys.」
Leonard:「''(Letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon)'' Uh, hi Penny. ''(Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.)'' Take a break, guys!」
Penny:「What are you doing?」
Leonard:「Oh, just, you know, moving... something upstairs.」
Penny:「What is it?」
Leonard:「It's... you know, time machine.」
Penny:「Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so....」
Leonard:「Uh, just give us a few minutes.」
Penny:「I don't have a few minutes, I'm running really late.」
Sheldon:「Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there's a small gap, don't look down if you're subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell.」
Penny:「You're joking, right?」
Sheldon:「Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo.」
Penny:「Damn, okay, I'll just take the roof.」
