Leonard:「Why not?」
Howard:「Becauth ''(pretends tongue has swollen up)'' Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water.」
Leonard:「Alright, I’ll be right back.」
Howard:「''(Into phone)'' Penny, look, I’ve got a problem.」
Penny:「''(With Sheldon in background at the head of a large queue of customers)'' Yeah, well so do I, look you’ve got to stall Leonard a little longer.」
Howard:「I don’t think I can.」
Penny:「You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell “surprise!”」
Howard:「Okay, you have to understand something, we’re in a hospital right now.」
Penny:「Why, is Leonard okay.」
Howard:「Leonard's fine. I'm fine, thanks for asking, by the way.」
Penny:「Okay, I don't need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer.」
Howard:「Look, I’ve done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop him.」
Penny:「Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy.」
Howard:「Don't toy with me, woman.」
Penny:「I’ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I’ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who's two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.」
