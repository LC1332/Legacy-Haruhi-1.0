Sheldon:「My apologies Leonard, I'm only as good as my teacher.」
Leonard:「Why are you learning Chinese?」
Sheldon:「I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them.」
Leonard:「If I were you, I'd be more concerned by what they're passing off as chicken.」
Penny:「''(Storming in)'' I need to use your window.」
Leonard:「Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead.」
Penny:「''(Opening window)'' Hey Jerkface, you forgot your iPod! ''(Throws it out the window.)''」
Leonard:「What's going on?」
Penny:「Oh, I'll tell you what's going on, that stupid self-centered bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. ''(Out of window)'' Drop dead, you stupid self-centered bastard! ''(To Leonard)'' Thank you. ''(exit)''」
