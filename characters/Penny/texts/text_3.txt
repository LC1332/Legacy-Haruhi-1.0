Leonard:「At least I didn't have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.」
Sheldon:「I didn't invent them, they're there.」
Leonard:「In what universe?」
Sheldon:「In all of them, that is the point.」
Penny:「Uh, do you guys mind if I start?」
Sheldon:「Um, Penny... that's where I sit.」
Penny:「So, sit next to me.」
Sheldon:「... No, I sit there.」
Penny:「What's the difference?」
Sheldon:「"What’s the difference"?」
Leonard:「Here we go.」
Sheldon:「In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion. I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point.」
Penny:「Do you want me to move?」
