Harry:「Hello. How come you’re not at the feast?」
Luna:「Well, I’ve lost most of my possessions, People take them and hide them, you know. But as it’s the last night, I really do need them back, so I’ve been putting up signs.」
Harry:「How come people hide your stuff?」
Luna:「Oh . . . well . . . I think they think I’m a bit odd, you know. Some people call me ‘Loony’ Lovegood, actually.」
Harry:「Just didn’t feel like it.」
Luna:「No, I don’t suppose you do. That man the Death Eaters killed was your godfather, wasn’t he? Ginny told me.」
Harry:「I’m sorry.」
Luna:「Yes, it was rather horrible, I still feel very sad about it sometimes. But I’ve still got Dad. And anyway, it’s not as though I’ll never see Mum again, is it?」
Harry:「You mean . . .」
Luna:「In that room with the archway. They were just lurking out of sight, that’s all. You heard them.」
