Dumbledore:「Very good. So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you. . . . A clever plan, a very clever plan . . . and, as you say, right under my nose.」
Malfoy:「Yeah, yeah, it was!」
Dumbledore:「But there were times when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong hands . . . poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink. . . .」
Malfoy:「Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind that stuff, did you?」
Dumbledore:「I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over you on my orders —」
Malfoy:「He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my mother —」
