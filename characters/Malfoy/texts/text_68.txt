Umbridge:「Well, it looks as though Hogwarts will shortly be a Weasley-free zone, doesn’t it?」
Malfoy:「laughs loudly and sycophantically」
Umbridge:「So, Potter, You stationed lookouts around my office and you sent this buffoon, to tell me the poltergeist was wreaking havoc in the Transfiguration department when I knew perfectly well that he was busy smearing ink on the eyepieces of all the school telescopes, Mr. Filch having just informed me so. Clearly, it was very important for you to talk to somebody. Was it Albus Dumbledore? Or the half-breed, Hagrid? I doubt it was Minerva McGonagall, I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone . . .」
Malfoy:「laughed」
