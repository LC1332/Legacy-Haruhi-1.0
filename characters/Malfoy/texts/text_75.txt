Ron:「Listen!」
Malfoy:「you know how to fix it?」
Borgin:「Possibly, I’ll need to see it, though. Why don’t you bring it into the shop?」
Malfoy:「It’s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.」
Malfoy:「Tell anyone, and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He’s a family friend. He’ll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you’re giving the problem your full attention.」
Borgin:「Perhaps you’d like to take it now?」
Malfoy:「No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don’t sell it.」
Malfoy:「stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself」
