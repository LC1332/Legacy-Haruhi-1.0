Dumbledore:「Good evening, Draco.」
Malfoy:「Who else is here? A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?」
Harry:「No, I’ve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight.」
Dumbledore:「Very good indeed. You found a way to let them in, did you?」
Malfoy:「Yeah, Right under your nose and you never realized!」
Dumbledore:「Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy.」
Narrator:Harry think "Harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of them, his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Eaters’ distant fight, and in front of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore, who, incredibly, smiled."
Malfoy:「Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.」
Malfoy:「It has been in it! I’ve been working on it all year, and tonight —」
Dumbledore:「You are afraid to act until they join you.」
Malfoy:「I’m not afraid! It’s you who should be scared!」
