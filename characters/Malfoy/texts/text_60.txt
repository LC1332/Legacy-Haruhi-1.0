Hermione:「Well, come on, we’d better get going, if she’s inspecting Binns’s class we don’t want to be late . . .」
Narrator:Snape think "I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L. This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination. The general standard of this homework was abysmal. Most of you would have failed had this been your examination. I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week’s essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes, or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D’s."
Malfoy:「Some people got D’s? Ha!」
