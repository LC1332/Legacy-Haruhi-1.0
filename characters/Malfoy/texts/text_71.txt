Bellatrix:「He dared — he dares — He stands there — filthy half-blood —」
Malfoy:「WAIT UNTIL WE’VE GOT THE PROPHECY!」
Harry:「You haven’t told me what’s so special about this prophecy I’m supposed to be handing over. I’m not playing games.」
Harry:「Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries? What about my scar?」
Malfoy:「Can this be? Well, this explains why you didn’t come earlier, Potter, the Dark Lord wondered why — when I say go — you didn’t come running when he showed you the place where it was hidden in your dreams. He thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording . . .」
Malfoy:「Because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the Department of Mysteries, Potter, are those about whom it was made, as the Dark Lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him. Haven’t you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby?」
