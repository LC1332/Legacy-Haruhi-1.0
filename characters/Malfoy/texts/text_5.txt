Narrator:「No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.」
Malfoy:「I do feel so sorry for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they’re not wanted at home.」
