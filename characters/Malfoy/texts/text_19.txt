Ron:「jaw dropped」
Malfoy:「Father won’t tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing — last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it’s a matter of time before one of them’s killed this time. . . . I hope it’s Granger」
Ron:「clenching Crabbe’s gigantic fists」
Harry:「D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?」
Malfoy:「whoever it was was expelled. They’re probably still in Azkaban」
